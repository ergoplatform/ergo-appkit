  "summary": "The `ExtendedInputBox` class is a data structure that represents an input box in the Ergo blockchain. An input box is an ErgoBox that is used as an input to a transaction. The `ExtendedInputBox` class pairs an `ErgoBox` instance with a set of context variables, which are necessary to satisfy the box's guarding proposition. The context variables are stored in a `ContextExtension` object.\n\nThe `ExtendedInputBox` class has two properties: `box` and `extension`. The `box` property is an instance of the `ErgoBox` class, which represents the input box. The `extension` property is a set of context variables that are necessary to satisfy the box's guarding proposition. The `extension` property is stored in a `ContextExtension` object.\n\nThe `ExtendedInputBox` class has one method: `toUnsignedInput`. This method returns an `UnsignedInput` object, which represents the input box as an unsigned input in a transaction. The `UnsignedInput` object is created using the input box's ID and the context variables stored in the `ContextExtension` object.\n\nThis class is used in the larger Ergo blockchain project to represent input boxes in transactions. It allows developers to easily pair an input box with the necessary context variables and create an unsigned input for a transaction. Here is an example of how this class might be used in a transaction:\n\n```scala\nval inputBox = new ErgoBox(...)\nval contextVars = new ContextExtension(...)\nval extendedInputBox = ExtendedInputBox(inputBox, contextVars)\nval unsignedInput = extendedInputBox.toUnsignedInput\n```\n\nIn this example, a new `ErgoBox` object is created to represent the input box. A new `ContextExtension` object is also created to store the necessary context variables. The `ExtendedInputBox` class is then used to pair the input box with the context variables. Finally, the `toUnsignedInput` method is called to create an unsigned input for the transaction.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `ExtendedInputBox` class?\n   - The `ExtendedInputBox` class represents an input `ErgoBox` paired with context variables necessary to satisfy the box's guarding proposition in a transaction.\n2. What is the `toUnsignedInput` method used for?\n   - The `toUnsignedInput` method is used to convert an `ExtendedInputBox` instance into an `UnsignedInput` instance, which is used in a signed transaction.\n3. What is the significance of the `extension` parameter in the `ExtendedInputBox` constructor?\n   - The `extension` parameter represents a set of context variables necessary to satisfy the box's guarding proposition, and is also saved in the corresponding `Input` instance of the signed transaction."
