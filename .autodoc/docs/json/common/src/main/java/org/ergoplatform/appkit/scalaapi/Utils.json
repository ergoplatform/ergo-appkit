  "summary": "The `Utils` object provides several utility functions that can be used across the `ergo-appkit` project. \n\nThe `outerJoin` function performs an outer join operation between two maps, `left` and `right`. It takes three projection functions as arguments: `l`, `r`, and `inner`. The `l` function is executed for each element of the `left` map, the `r` function is executed for each element of the `right` map, and the `inner` function is executed for matching items `(K, L)` and `(K, R)` with the same `K`. The function returns a map of `(K, O)` pairs, where each key comes from either the `left` or `right` map and values are produced by the projections. \n\nHere is an example of how to use the `outerJoin` function:\n\n```scala\nval left = Map(\"a\" -> 1, \"b\" -> 2)\nval right = Map(\"b\" -> 3, \"c\" -> 4)\n\nval result = Utils.outerJoin(left, right)(\n  (k, l) => l + 1, \n  (k, r) => r * 2, \n  (k, l, r) => l + r\n)\n\n// result: Map(\"a\" -> 2, \"b\" -> 5, \"c\" -> 8)\n```\n\nThe `mapReduce` function is a performance-optimized deterministic mapReduce primitive. It takes an array `arr` to be mapped to `(K, V)` pairs, a mapper function `m`, and a value reduction function `r`. The function returns a pair of arrays `(keys, values)`, where keys appear in order of their first production by `m` and for each `i => values(i)` corresponds to `keys(i)`. \n\nHere is an example of how to use the `mapReduce` function:\n\n```scala\nval arr = Array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n\nval (keys, values) = Utils.mapReduce(arr, \n  (a: Int) => (a % 2, a), \n  (a: (Int, Int)) => a._1 + a._2\n)\n\n// keys: Array(1, 0)\n// values: Array(9, 6)\n```\n\nThe `mapToArrays` function converts a `Map` to a tuple of arrays, where the first array contains all keys of the map and the second array contains all values of the map. \n\nHere is an example of how to use the `mapToArrays` function:\n\n```scala\nval m = Map(\"a\" -> 1, \"b\" -> 2, \"c\" -> 3)\n\nval (keys, values) = Utils.mapToArrays(m)\n\n// keys: Array(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\")\n// values: Array(1, 2, 3)\n```\n\nThe `IntegralFromExactIntegral` class can adapt an `ExactIntegral` instance to be used where `Integral` is required. It implements the `Integral` trait and provides implementations for all of its methods. \n\nHere is an example of how to use the `IntegralFromExactIntegral` class:\n\n```scala\nimport scalan.math.Rational\n\nval ei = new ExactIntegral[Rational] {\n  override def plus(x: Rational, y: Rational): Rational = x + y\n  override def minus(x: Rational, y: Rational): Rational = x - y\n  override def times(x: Rational, y: Rational): Rational = x * y\n  override def negate(x: Rational): Rational = -x\n  override def fromInt(x: Int): Rational = Rational(x)\n  override def toInt(x: Rational): Int = x.toInt\n  override def toLong(x: Rational): Long = x.toLong\n  override def toFloat(x: Rational): Float = x.toFloat\n  override def toDouble(x: Rational): Double = x.toDouble\n  override def compare(x: Rational, y: Rational): Int = x.compare(y)\n  override def divisionRemainder(x: Rational, y: Rational): Rational = x % y\n  override def quot(x: Rational, y: Rational): Rational = x / y\n}\n\nval integral = new Utils.IntegralFromExactIntegral(ei)\n\nval a = Rational(3, 4)\nval b = Rational(1, 2)\n\nval sum = integral.plus(a, b) // Rational(5, 4)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What does the `outerJoin` function do and how is it used?\n- The `outerJoin` function performs an outer join operation between two maps, with optional projection functions for each map and a third projection function for matching items. It returns a map of (K, O) pairs. It can be used to combine data from two maps based on a common key.\n2. What is the purpose of the `mapReduce` function and how is it different from a regular `map` and `reduce` operation?\n- The `mapReduce` function is a performance-optimized deterministic mapReduce primitive that takes an array and applies a mapper function to produce (K, V) pairs, then reduces the values for each key using a value reduction function. It returns a pair of arrays (keys, values) where keys appear in order of their first production by the mapper function. It is different from a regular `map` and `reduce` operation because it guarantees the order of the keys and values in the output.\n3. What is the purpose of the `IntegralFromExactIntegral` class and how is it used?\n- The `IntegralFromExactIntegral` class can adapt an `ExactIntegral` instance to be used where `Integral` is required. It provides implementations for all `Integral` methods using the corresponding methods from `ExactIntegral`. It can be used to convert between different numeric types with different precision and rounding behavior."
