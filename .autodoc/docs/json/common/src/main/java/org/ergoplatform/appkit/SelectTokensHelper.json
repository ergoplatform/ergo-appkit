  "summary": "The `SelectTokensHelper` class is a utility class that helps to keep track of the amount of tokens that need to be spent and the tokens that have already been covered by boxes. It is used to determine which boxes need to be selected and if a change box is needed. \n\nThe class has a constructor that takes an iterable of `ErgoToken` objects, which represent the tokens that need to be spent. The constructor initializes a `HashMap` called `tokensLeft` that maps the token ID to the amount of tokens left to spend. It also initializes a boolean variable called `changeBoxNeeded` to false.\n\nThe class has several methods that can be used to interact with the `tokensLeft` map. The `areTokensNeeded` method takes an iterable of `ErgoToken` objects and checks if the given tokens are needed to fulfill the tokens to spend. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the found tokens were needed to fill the tokens left.\n\nThe `useTokens` method takes an iterable of `ErgoToken` objects and marks the given tokens as selected, subtracting the amount values from the remaining amount of tokens needed to fulfill the initial tokens to spend. It also keeps track if a change box is needed in case too many tokens were selected. The method returns the `SelectTokensHelper` object itself, allowing for method chaining.\n\nThe `areTokensCovered` method checks if the currently selected tokens can fulfill the initial tokens to spend. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the tokens are covered.\n\nThe `getRemainingTokenList` method returns a list of `ErgoToken` objects representing the tokens that still need to be spent.\n\nThe `isChangeBoxNeeded` method returns a boolean value indicating whether a change box is needed. This is the case if more tokens were selected than needed to spend.\n\nOverall, the `SelectTokensHelper` class provides a convenient way to keep track of tokens that need to be spent and tokens that have already been covered by boxes. It can be used in the larger project to facilitate the selection of boxes and the creation of change boxes. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nList<ErgoToken> tokensToSpend = new ArrayList<>();\ntokensToSpend.add(new ErgoToken(\"token1\", 10));\ntokensToSpend.add(new ErgoToken(\"token2\", 5));\n\nSelectTokensHelper helper = new SelectTokensHelper(tokensToSpend);\n\nList<ErgoToken> foundTokens = new ArrayList<>();\nfoundTokens.add(new ErgoToken(\"token1\", 5));\nfoundTokens.add(new ErgoToken(\"token2\", 5));\n\nboolean tokensNeeded = helper.areTokensNeeded(foundTokens); // returns false\n\nhelper.useTokens(foundTokens);\n\nboolean tokensCovered = helper.areTokensCovered(); // returns true\n\nList<ErgoToken> remainingTokens = helper.getRemainingTokenList(); // returns empty list\n\nboolean changeBoxNeeded = helper.isChangeBoxNeeded(); // returns false\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `SelectTokensHelper` class?\n- The `SelectTokensHelper` class is a helper class used to keep track of the amount of tokens to spend and tokens already covered by boxes. It is used to determine if more and which boxes need to be selected, and if a change box is needed.\n\n2. What methods are available in the `SelectTokensHelper` class?\n- The `SelectTokensHelper` class has several methods available, including `areTokensNeeded()`, `useTokens()`, `areTokensCovered()`, `getRemainingTokenList()`, and `isChangeBoxNeeded()`.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `areTokensNeeded()` method?\n- The `areTokensNeeded()` method checks if the given tokens are needed to fulfill the tokens to spend. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the found tokens were needed to fill the tokens left."
