  "summary": "The `MnemonicValidationException` class is a custom exception class that is used to handle errors that may occur during the validation of a mnemonic phrase. A mnemonic phrase is a sequence of words that can be used to generate a cryptographic key. This class is part of the `ergo-appkit` project and is used to validate the mnemonic phrases used in the project.\n\nThe `MnemonicValidationException` class extends the `Exception` class, which is the base class for all exceptions in Java. It has two constructors, one with no arguments and one that takes a message string as an argument. The message string is used to provide additional information about the exception.\n\nThe `MnemonicValidationException` class also has three nested classes that extend it: `MnemonicEmptyException`, `MnemonicWrongListSizeException`, and `MnemonicChecksumException`. These classes are used to handle specific types of errors that may occur during the validation of a mnemonic phrase.\n\nThe `MnemonicEmptyException` class is thrown when an argument to the `MnemonicCode` is empty. The `MnemonicWrongListSizeException` class is thrown when an argument to the `MnemonicCode` is of the wrong list size. The `MnemonicChecksumException` class is thrown when a list of `MnemonicCode` words fails the checksum check.\n\nThe `MnemonicWordException` class is also a nested class that extends `MnemonicValidationException`. It is thrown when a word is encountered that is not in the `MnemonicCode`'s word list. This class contains a `badWord` field that contains the word that was not found in the word list.\n\nOverall, the `MnemonicValidationException` class is an important part of the `ergo-appkit` project as it provides a way to handle errors that may occur during the validation of a mnemonic phrase. By using this class, developers can ensure that their code is robust and can handle errors gracefully. Here is an example of how this class can be used:\n\n```\ntry {\n    Mnemonic.checkEnglishMnemonic(mnemonicWords);\n} catch (MnemonicValidationException e) {\n    // Handle the exception here\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n    \n    This code defines a set of exceptions that can be raised when validating a mnemonic phrase in the Ergo Platform appkit.\n\n2. What are the different types of exceptions that can be raised?\n    \n    There are four different types of exceptions that can be raised: `MnemonicEmptyException`, `MnemonicWrongListSizeException`, `MnemonicChecksumException`, and `MnemonicWordException`.\n\n3. What information is contained in the `MnemonicWordException` exception?\n    \n    The `MnemonicWordException` exception contains the word that was not found in the word list that is being used to validate the mnemonic phrase."
