  "summary": "The `ErgoType` class is a Java-friendly wrapper around the `RType` type descriptor in the ErgoScript language. It provides a runtime representation of ErgoScript types, which can be used to create instances of these types and perform operations on them. \n\nThe class contains a set of static methods that create instances of `ErgoType` for various ErgoScript types, such as `Byte`, `Short`, `Integer`, `Long`, `Boolean`, `BigInt`, `Unit`, `GroupElement`, `SigmaProp`, `AvlTree`, `Box`, `Header`, and `PreHeader`. These methods return pre-defined instances of `ErgoType` for each type, which can be used to create instances of these types and perform operations on them. \n\nFor example, to create an instance of the `Box` type, you can use the `boxType()` method:\n\n```\nErgoType<Box> boxType = ErgoType.boxType();\n```\n\nThe class also provides two additional static methods: `pairType()` and `collType()`. The `pairType()` method creates an instance of `ErgoType` for a tuple of two types, while the `collType()` method creates an instance of `ErgoType` for a collection of a specific type. \n\nFor example, to create an instance of `ErgoType` for a tuple of `Int` and `Boolean` types, you can use the `pairType()` method:\n\n```\nErgoType<Integer> intType = ErgoType.integerType();\nErgoType<Boolean> boolType = ErgoType.booleanType();\nErgoType<Tuple2<Integer, Boolean>> pairType = ErgoType.pairType(intType, boolType);\n```\n\nOverall, the `ErgoType` class provides a convenient way to work with ErgoScript types in Java code. It allows developers to create instances of ErgoScript types and perform operations on them without having to deal with the low-level details of the ErgoScript language.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `ErgoType` class?\n- The `ErgoType` class is a Java-friendly wrapper around the `RType` type descriptor, which represents the runtime representation of ErgoScript types.\n\n2. What are some examples of ErgoScript types that can be represented by an `ErgoType` instance?\n- Examples of ErgoScript types that can be represented by an `ErgoType` instance include `Byte`, `Short`, `Integer`, `Long`, `Boolean`, `BigInt`, `Unit`, `GroupElement`, `SigmaProp`, `AvlTree`, `Box`, `Header`, and `PreHeader`.\n\n3. How can a developer create a new `ErgoType` instance for a custom type?\n- A developer can create a new `ErgoType` instance for a custom type by calling the `ofRType` static method and passing in an `RType` instance that represents the custom type."
