  "summary": "The `BabelFeeBoxStateBuilder` class is a builder that allows for the creation of a `BabelFeeBoxState` object with self-defined information. The `BabelFeeBoxState` object represents a box that contains a certain amount of tokens and nanoErgs, and is used to pay for transaction fees on the Ergo blockchain. \n\nThe `BabelFeeBoxStateBuilder` class has several methods that allow for the setting of different properties of the `BabelFeeBoxState` object. These methods include `withPricePerToken`, `withTokenId`, `withBoxCreator`, `withValue`, and `withTokenAmount`. Each of these methods sets a specific property of the `BabelFeeBoxState` object. \n\nThe `withPricePerToken` method sets the price per token of the `BabelFeeBoxState` object. The `withTokenId` method sets the ID of the token that the `BabelFeeBoxState` object contains. The `withBoxCreator` method sets the creator of the `BabelFeeBoxState` object. This can be either a `SigmaProp` object or an `Address` object. The `withValue` method sets the amount of nanoErgs that the `BabelFeeBoxState` object contains. The `withTokenAmount` method sets the amount of tokens that the `BabelFeeBoxState` object contains. \n\nThe `build` method creates a new `BabelFeeBoxState` object with the properties that have been set using the builder methods. Before creating the object, the method checks that the `boxCreator` and `tokenId` properties have been set, and that the `value` and `pricePerToken` properties are greater than 0. If any of these conditions are not met, an exception is thrown. \n\nOverall, the `BabelFeeBoxStateBuilder` class provides a convenient way to create `BabelFeeBoxState` objects with custom properties. This can be useful in the larger project when creating transactions that require payment of transaction fees using `BabelFeeBoxState` objects. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nBabelFeeBoxStateBuilder builder = new BabelFeeBoxStateBuilder();\nBabelFeeBoxState boxState = builder\n    .withPricePerToken(1000000)\n    .withTokenId(tokenId)\n    .withBoxCreator(boxCreator)\n    .withValue(1000000000)\n    .withTokenAmount(10)\n    .build();\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `BabelFeeBoxStateBuilder` class?\n    \n    The `BabelFeeBoxStateBuilder` class is used to conveniently instantiate a `BabelFeeBoxState` object with self-defined information.\n\n2. What are the required parameters for building a `BabelFeeBoxState` object?\n    \n    The required parameters for building a `BabelFeeBoxState` object are `pricePerToken`, `tokenId`, `boxCreator`, `value`, and `tokenAmount`.\n\n3. What happens if the `value` or `pricePerToken` parameters are less than or equal to 0?\n    \n    If the `value` or `pricePerToken` parameters are less than or equal to 0, an `IllegalArgumentException` will be thrown."
