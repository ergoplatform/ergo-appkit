  "summary": "The `ErgoProver` interface is part of the `ergo-appkit` project and defines the methods that a prover must implement to sign transactions and messages. \n\nThe `ErgoProver` interface has several methods that allow the prover to sign transactions and messages. The `getP2PKAddress()` method returns the Pay-To-Public-Key address of the prover. The `getAddress()` method returns the Pay-To-Public-Key address of the prover represented as an `Address` object. The `getSecretKey()` method returns the master secret key of the prover. The `getEip3Addresses()` method returns a list of `Address` objects that correspond to the Ethereum Improvement Proposal 3 (EIP-3) addresses derived from the master secret key.\n\nThe `sign()` method signs an unsigned transaction using the configured secrets. The `sign()` method with two parameters signs an unsigned transaction and takes a `baseCost` parameter that represents the computational cost before the transaction validation. The `signMessage()` method signs an arbitrary message under a key representing a statement provable via a sigma-protocol. The `reduce()` method reduces an unsigned transaction to a reduced transaction. The `signReduced()` method signs a reduced transaction and takes a `baseCost` parameter that represents the computational cost before the transaction validation.\n\nOverall, the `ErgoProver` interface is an important part of the `ergo-appkit` project as it defines the methods that a prover must implement to sign transactions and messages. Developers can use this interface to create custom provers that can sign transactions and messages in a variety of ways. Below is an example of how to use the `ErgoProver` interface to sign a transaction:\n\n```\nErgoProver prover = new MyCustomProver();\nUnsignedTransaction unsignedTx = new UnsignedTransaction();\nSignedTransaction signedTx = prover.sign(unsignedTx);\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n    \n    This code file defines the interface for an ErgoProver, which can be used to sign transactions and messages in the Ergo blockchain.\n\n2. What is the difference between the `sign` and `signReduced` methods?\n    \n    The `sign` method signs an unsigned transaction, while the `signReduced` method signs a reduced transaction. A reduced transaction is a version of the transaction that has been simplified to reduce the computational cost of signing it.\n\n3. What is the `hintsBag` parameter in the `signMessage` method used for?\n    \n    The `hintsBag` parameter provides additional hints for the signer, which can be useful for distributed signing."
