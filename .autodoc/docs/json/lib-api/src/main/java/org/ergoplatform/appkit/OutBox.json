  "summary": "The code above defines an interface called `OutBox` which represents output boxes on newly created transactions. Each `OutBox` corresponds to an `ErgoBoxCandidate` which is not yet part of the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) and hence doesn't have a transaction id and box index parameter. \n\nThe `OutBox` interface extends the `TransactionBox` interface, which means that it inherits all the methods defined in the `TransactionBox` interface. \n\nThe `OutBox` interface has two methods defined in it. The first method, `getBytesWithNoRef()`, returns the serialized bytes of this output box without any transaction reference data. This method can be used to get the serialized bytes of the output box, which can be useful for debugging purposes or for sending the output box to another node. \n\nThe second method, `convertToInputWith(String txId, short outputIndex)`, converts this box candidate into a new instance of `InputBox` by associating it with the given transaction and output position. This method can be used to create input boxes from scratch, without retrieving them from the UTXOs. Thus created boxes can be indistinguishable from those loaded from the blockchain node, and as a result, can be used to create new transactions. This method can also be used to create chains of transactions in advance. \n\nOverall, the `OutBox` interface is an important part of the `ergo-appkit` project as it provides a way to represent output boxes on newly created transactions and convert them into input boxes. This interface can be used by developers to create new transactions and interact with the Ergo blockchain. \n\nExample usage of `OutBox` interface:\n\n```java\nOutBox outBox = new OutBoxImpl(); // create a new instance of OutBox\nbyte[] bytes = outBox.getBytesWithNoRef(); // get the serialized bytes of the output box\nInputBox inputBox = outBox.convertToInputWith(\"txId\", (short) 0); // convert the output box to an input box\n```",
