  "summary": "The code above defines an interface called `BlockchainContextBuilder` that is used to build new blockchain contexts. A blockchain context is a data structure that contains information about the current state of the blockchain, such as the current block height, the current difficulty level, and the current set of UTXOs (unspent transaction outputs).\n\nThe `BlockchainContextBuilder` interface has one method called `build()` that returns a new `BlockchainContext` object. The `build()` method throws an `ErgoClientException` if there is an error while building the context.\n\nThe `BlockchainContextBuilder` interface also defines a constant called `NUM_LAST_HEADERS` that has a value of 10. This constant represents the number of block headers that are available in the context. A block header is a data structure that contains information about a block, such as its hash, its timestamp, and the hash of the previous block.\n\nThis interface can be used by developers who want to interact with the Ergo blockchain in their applications. They can create a new instance of a class that implements the `BlockchainContextBuilder` interface and use it to build a new `BlockchainContext` object. They can then use the `BlockchainContext` object to query the blockchain for information about blocks, transactions, and UTXOs.\n\nHere is an example of how this interface might be used in a larger project:\n\n```\n// Create a new instance of a class that implements the BlockchainContextBuilder interface\nBlockchainContextBuilder builder = new MyBlockchainContextBuilder();\n\n// Build a new BlockchainContext object\nBlockchainContext context = builder.build();\n\n// Use the BlockchainContext object to query the blockchain for information\nint currentHeight = context.getHeight();\nList<Utxo> utxos = context.getUtxos();\n```\n\nIn this example, `MyBlockchainContextBuilder` is a class that implements the `BlockchainContextBuilder` interface. The `build()` method in `MyBlockchainContextBuilder` collects the necessary parameters to build a new `BlockchainContext` object. The `getHeight()` and `getUtxos()` methods in the `BlockchainContext` object are used to query the blockchain for information about the current block height and the current set of UTXOs, respectively.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this interface?\n   - This interface is used to build new blockchain contexts.\n\n2. What is the significance of the NUM_LAST_HEADERS constant?\n   - The NUM_LAST_HEADERS constant represents the number of headers available in the context and is defined by the Ergo protocol.\n\n3. What exception can be thrown by the build() method?\n   - The build() method can throw an ErgoClientException."
