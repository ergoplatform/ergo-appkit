  "summary": "The `CoveringBoxes` class in the `ergo-appkit` project represents a collection of input boxes that cover a given amount of NanoErgs to spend. The class allows for partial coverage, which is useful for collecting boxes in multiple steps. \n\nThe class has four instance variables: `_amountToSpend`, `_boxes`, `tokensToSpend`, and `changeBoxNeeded`. `_amountToSpend` is the amount of NanoErgs to spend, `_boxes` is a list of input boxes that cover the amount, `tokensToSpend` is a list of tokens to spend, and `changeBoxNeeded` is a boolean value that indicates whether a change box is needed to spend the selected boxes. \n\nThe class has five methods. `getCoveredAmount()` returns the amount covered by the boxes in the set. `getCoveredTokens()` returns a list of tokens covered by the boxes. `isCovered()` returns true if the amount and tokens are covered by the boxes in the set, and false otherwise. `getBoxes()` returns a list of boxes stored in the set. `isChangeBoxNeeded()` returns true if a change box is needed to spend the selected boxes. \n\nThe `getCoveredAmount()` method iterates through the `_boxes` list and sums the value of each box to calculate the total amount covered. The `getCoveredTokens()` method iterates through the `_boxes` list and creates a `HashMap` of tokens covered by the boxes. If a token is already in the map, its value is updated. The method returns a list of values in the map. \n\nThe `isCovered()` method checks if the amount covered by the boxes is greater than or equal to the amount to spend and if the tokens to spend are covered by the boxes. It uses the `SelectTokensHelper` class to check if the tokens are covered. \n\nOverall, the `CoveringBoxes` class is a useful tool for managing input boxes that cover a given amount of NanoErgs to spend. It allows for partial coverage and provides methods for checking if the amount and tokens are covered by the boxes.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `CoveringBoxes` class?\n- The `CoveringBoxes` class represents a collection of boxes covering a given amount of NanoErgs to spend, allowing for partial coverage and collection of boxes in many steps.\n\n2. What does the `getCoveredTokens` method do?\n- The `getCoveredTokens` method returns a list of tokens covered by the boxes in the `CoveringBoxes` set.\n\n3. What does the `isCovered` method check for?\n- The `isCovered` method checks if the amount and tokens are covered by the boxes in the `CoveringBoxes` set, returning true if they are and false otherwise."
