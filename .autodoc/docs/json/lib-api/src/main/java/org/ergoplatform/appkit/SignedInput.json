  "summary": "The code above defines an interface called `SignedInput` which represents an input of a `SignedTransaction`. A `SignedInput` contains information necessary to spend the input, including proofs of knowledge of necessary secrets (aka signatures). These proofs are generated by an `ErgoProver` configured with the secrets. When the transaction is validated, the proofs are verified (this is a generalization of a signature verification). \n\nThe `SignedInput` interface has four methods. The `getProofBytes()` method returns the bytes of the generated proofs (aka generalized signature). The `getContextVars()` method returns context variables attached by the prover to this input. These variables will be passed to the contract which protects this input. Each variable is accessible by id using the `getVar` function of ErgoScript. The `getId()` method returns the id of the box, which will be spent by the transaction. Finally, the `getTransaction()` method returns the transaction which contains this input.\n\nThis interface is an important part of the `ergo-appkit` project as it allows developers to create and manipulate `SignedInput` objects, which are necessary for creating and validating transactions on the Ergo blockchain. For example, a developer could create a `SignedInput` object and set its `proofBytes` and `contextVars` fields to the appropriate values, then add it to a `SignedTransaction` object using the `addInput()` method. The `SignedTransaction` object could then be signed and broadcast to the network using the `ErgoClient` class. \n\nOverall, the `SignedInput` interface provides a way for developers to interact with inputs in a transaction, including providing the necessary proofs and context variables for validation.",
