  "summary": "The `UnsignedTransactionBuilderImpl` class is a part of the `ergo-appkit` project and is used to build unsigned transactions for the Ergo blockchain. The class implements the `UnsignedTransactionBuilder` interface and provides methods to add inputs, outputs, and data inputs to the transaction, specify the fee, tokens to burn, and change address, and build the unsigned transaction.\n\nThe class has several private fields, including lists of input boxes, output boxes, and data input boxes, as well as options for tokens to burn, fee amount, change address, and pre-header. The class also has a method to create an `ErgoLikeStateContext` object that is used to validate the transaction.\n\nThe `UnsignedTransactionBuilderImpl` class provides several methods to add inputs, outputs, and data inputs to the transaction. The `addInputs` method adds one or more input boxes to the list of input boxes, while the `boxesToSpend` method sets the list of input boxes to the specified list. The `addDataInputs` method adds one or more data input boxes to the list of data input boxes, while the `withDataInputs` method sets the list of data input boxes to the specified list. The `addOutputs` method adds one or more output boxes to the list of output boxes, while the `outputs` method sets the list of output boxes to the specified list.\n\nThe `UnsignedTransactionBuilderImpl` class also provides methods to specify the fee, tokens to burn, and change address. The `fee` method sets the fee amount for the transaction, while the `tokensToBurn` method sets the tokens to burn for the transaction. The `sendChangeTo` method sets the change address for the transaction.\n\nThe `UnsignedTransactionBuilderImpl` class provides a `build` method that builds the unsigned transaction using the specified inputs, outputs, data inputs, fee, tokens to burn, and change address. The method creates an `ErgoLikeStateContext` object and uses it to validate the transaction. The method returns an `UnsignedTransactionImpl` object that represents the unsigned transaction.\n\nOverall, the `UnsignedTransactionBuilderImpl` class is an important part of the `ergo-appkit` project that provides a convenient way to build unsigned transactions for the Ergo blockchain. Developers can use this class to create and validate transactions without having to write low-level code.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `UnsignedTransactionBuilderImpl` class?\n- The `UnsignedTransactionBuilderImpl` class is used to build unsigned transactions for the Ergo blockchain.\n\n2. What are some of the methods available in the `UnsignedTransactionBuilderImpl` class?\n- Some of the methods available in the `UnsignedTransactionBuilderImpl` class include `preHeader`, `addInputs`, `addDataInputs`, `addOutputs`, `fee`, `tokensToBurn`, and `sendChangeTo`.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `createErgoLikeStateContext` method?\n- The `createErgoLikeStateContext` method is used to create an `ErgoLikeStateContext` object that contains information about the current state of the Ergo blockchain, including the headers and pre-header."
