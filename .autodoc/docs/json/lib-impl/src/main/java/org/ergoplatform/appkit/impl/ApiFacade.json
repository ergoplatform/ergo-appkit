  "summary": "The `ApiFacade` class in the `ergo-appkit` project provides helper methods for executing API requests using the Retrofit library. The class is abstract and contains two static methods and one interface.\n\nThe `clientError` method creates a new instance of the `ErgoClientException` class with the given cause and uses the given `Retrofit` instance to format the error message. This method is used to wrap any exceptions that occur during API request execution and provide a more informative error message to the user.\n\nThe `Supplier` interface is a helper interface that defines a single method `get()` which can throw two checked exceptions: `NoSuchMethodException` and `IOException`. This interface is used to define a block of code that can be executed by the `execute` method.\n\nThe `execute` method takes a `Retrofit` instance and a `Supplier` block as input parameters. It executes the given `Supplier` block and returns the result of the block execution. If an exception occurs during the block execution, the `clientError` method is called to wrap the exception in an `ErgoClientException` and provide a more informative error message. This method is used to execute API requests and handle any exceptions that may occur during the request execution.\n\nOverall, the `ApiFacade` class provides a simple and convenient way to execute API requests using the Retrofit library and handle any exceptions that may occur during the request execution. Here is an example of how this class can be used:\n\n```\nRetrofit retrofit = new Retrofit.Builder()\n        .baseUrl(\"https://api.example.com/\")\n        .build();\n\nApiFacade.execute(retrofit, () -> {\n    // execute API request and return result\n    return someResult;\n});\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `ApiFacade` class?\n    \n    The `ApiFacade` class is an abstract class that provides helper methods for executing API requests using a `Retrofit` instance.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `clientError` method?\n    \n    The `clientError` method creates a new instance of `ErgoClientException` with a formatted error message using the `Retrofit` instance and the cause of the error.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `Supplier` interface?\n    \n    The `Supplier` interface is a helper interface that defines a method for getting a result and throwing necessary exceptions. It is used in the `execute` method to execute a block of code and return the result."
