  "summary": "The `Eip4TokenBuilder` class provides convenience methods for building an `Eip4Token`, which is a type of token used in the Ergo blockchain. The class contains several static methods that can be used to build an `Eip4Token` from different sources, such as hex-encoded registers, additional registers returned by the Ergo Explorer API, or an `ErgoBox` object.\n\nThe `buildFromHexEncodedRegisters` method takes a token ID, token amount, and a list of hex-encoded register values for registers R4-R9. It decodes the register values and creates an `Eip4Token` object with the given parameters.\n\nThe `buildFromAdditionalRegisters` method takes a token ID, token amount, and an `AdditionalRegisters` object returned by the Ergo Explorer API. It extracts the register values for registers R4-R9 from the `AdditionalRegisters` object and creates an `Eip4Token` object using the `buildFromHexEncodedRegisters` method.\n\nThe `buildFromExplorerByTokenId` and `buildFromExplorerByIssuingBox` methods use the Ergo Explorer API to retrieve information about a token or an issuing box and create an `Eip4Token` object from the returned data.\n\nThe `buildFromErgoBox` method takes a token ID and an `ErgoBox` object and creates an `Eip4Token` object from the token information stored in the `ErgoBox`.\n\nThe class also provides several methods for building specific types of `Eip4Token` objects, such as NFT picture, video, and audio tokens, as well as an NFT artwork collection token.\n\nOverall, the `Eip4TokenBuilder` class provides a convenient way to create `Eip4Token` objects from various sources, making it easier to work with tokens in the Ergo blockchain.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Eip4TokenBuilder` class?\n- The `Eip4TokenBuilder` class provides convenience methods for building an `Eip4Token`, which is a type of token used in the Ergo blockchain.\n\n2. What are the required and optional registers for building an EIP-4 compliant minting box?\n- The required registers for building an EIP-4 compliant minting box are R4, R5, and R6. The optional registers are R7, R8, and R9.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `buildFromExplorerByTokenId` method?\n- The `buildFromExplorerByTokenId` method builds an `Eip4Token` from the information retrieved from the Ergo Explorer API using a token ID."
