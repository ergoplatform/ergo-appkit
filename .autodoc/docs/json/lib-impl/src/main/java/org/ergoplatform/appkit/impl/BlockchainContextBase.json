  "summary": "The `BlockchainContextBase` class is an abstract class that provides a base implementation for the `BlockchainContext` interface. It contains methods for creating and compiling Ergo contracts, getting the network type, and parsing reduced and signed transactions. \n\nThe `newContract` method takes an `ErgoTree` and returns an `ErgoContract` object. This method is used to create a new contract from an `ErgoTree`. The `compileContract` method takes `Constants` and an `ergoScript` string and returns an `ErgoContract` object. This method is used to compile an `ergoScript` into an `ErgoContract`.\n\nThe `getNetworkType` method returns the network type of the blockchain context. This method is used to get the network type of the blockchain context.\n\nThe `parseReducedTransaction` method takes a byte array of a reduced transaction and returns a `ReducedTransaction` object. This method is used to parse a reduced transaction.\n\nThe `parseSignedTransaction` method takes a byte array of a signed transaction and returns a `SignedTransaction` object. This method is used to parse a signed transaction.\n\nOverall, the `BlockchainContextBase` class provides a base implementation for the `BlockchainContext` interface. It is used to create and compile Ergo contracts, get the network type, and parse reduced and signed transactions. This class can be extended to provide additional functionality for a specific blockchain context. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nBlockchainContext context = new BlockchainContextBase(NetworkType.MAINNET);\nErgoContract contract = context.compileContract(ConstantsBuilder.create().build(), \"sigmaProp(true)\");\nNetworkType networkType = context.getNetworkType();\nbyte[] txBytes = ... // get transaction bytes\nReducedTransaction reducedTx = context.parseReducedTransaction(txBytes);\nSignedTransaction signedTx = context.parseSignedTransaction(txBytes);\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `BlockchainContextBase` class?\n- The `BlockchainContextBase` class is an abstract class that implements the `BlockchainContext` interface and provides some common functionality for blockchain contexts.\n\n2. What is the difference between `ReducedTransaction` and `SignedTransaction`?\n- `ReducedTransaction` is a reduced version of an `ErgoLikeTransaction` that contains only the essential information, while `SignedTransaction` is a fully signed `ErgoLikeTransaction` that can be broadcasted to the network.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `parseReducedTransaction` method?\n- The `parseReducedTransaction` method takes a byte array that represents a serialized reduced transaction and returns a `ReducedTransaction` object that can be used to interact with the transaction."
