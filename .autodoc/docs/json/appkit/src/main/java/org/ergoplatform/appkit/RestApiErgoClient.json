  "summary": "The `RestApiErgoClient` class is an implementation of the `ErgoClient` interface that uses the REST API of an Ergo node for communication. It provides methods for creating instances of the `ErgoClient` interface that are connected to a given node of the Ergo network, with or without an explorer connection.\n\nThe `RestApiErgoClient` constructor takes in the following parameters:\n- `nodeUrl`: the http url to the Ergo node REST API endpoint\n- `networkType`: the type of network (mainnet, testnet) the Ergo node is part of\n- `apiKey`: the api key to authenticate the client\n- `explorerUrl`: an optional http url to the Ergo Explorer REST API endpoint. If null or empty, the client works in the `node only` mode.\n- `httpClientBuilder`: an optional builder used to construct http client instances. If null, a new `OkHttpClient` with default parameters is used.\n\nThe `execute` method takes in a `Function` that operates on a `BlockchainContext` and returns a result of type `T`. It creates a `BlockchainContext` using a `BlockchainContextBuilderImpl` instance that takes in the `NodeAndExplorerDataSourceImpl` instance created by the constructor and the `networkType`. It then applies the given `Function` to the `BlockchainContext` and returns the result.\n\nThe `RestApiErgoClient` class also provides several static factory methods for creating instances of the `ErgoClient` interface:\n- `createWithoutExplorer`: creates a new instance of `ErgoClient` in the `node-only` mode, i.e. connected to a given node of the given network type and not connected to explorer.\n- `create`: creates a new instance of `ErgoClient` connected to a given node of the given network type.\n- `createWithHttpClientBuilder`: creates a new instance of `ErgoClient` connected to a given node of the given network type, with an optional `httpClientBuilder`.\n- `create`: creates a new instance of `ErgoClient` using node configuration parameters and an optional explorerUrl.\n- `createWithHttpClientBuilder`: creates a new instance of `ErgoClient` using node configuration parameters, an optional explorerUrl, and an optional `httpClientBuilder`.\n\nThe `RestApiErgoClient` class also provides a `getDataSource` method that returns the `NodeAndExplorerDataSourceImpl` instance created by the constructor.\n\nOverall, the `RestApiErgoClient` class provides a convenient way to create instances of the `ErgoClient` interface that are connected to a given node of the Ergo network, with or without an explorer connection. It abstracts away the details of creating and configuring the necessary API clients and provides a simple interface for executing operations on the Ergo blockchain.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code provides an implementation of the ErgoClient interface that uses the REST API of an Ergo node for communication.\n\n2. What are the parameters required to create a new instance of RestApiErgoClient?\n- To create a new instance of RestApiErgoClient, you need to provide the http url to the Ergo node REST API endpoint, the type of network the Ergo node is part of, an api key to authenticate the client, and an optional http url to the Ergo Explorer REST API endpoint.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the execute method in RestApiErgoClient?\n- The execute method in RestApiErgoClient takes a function that operates on a BlockchainContext and returns a result of type T. It creates a new BlockchainContext using the NodeAndExplorerDataSourceImpl and the network type, and applies the function to this context to obtain the result."
