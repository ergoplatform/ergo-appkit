  "summary": "The code represents a base class for all CLI (Command Line Interface) applications in the Appkit Commands framework. The purpose of this class is to provide a set of methods and properties that can be used by derived classes to create CLI applications. \n\nThe `CliApplication` class contains several methods that are used to parse command-line arguments, load configuration files, and execute commands. The `commands` method returns an array of `CmdDescriptor` objects that represent the commands supported by the application. The `commandsMap` method returns a map of command names to `CmdDescriptor` objects. \n\nThe `run` method is the main entry point for the application. It takes three arguments: `args`, `console`, and `clientFactory`. The `args` argument is an array of strings that represent the command-line arguments passed to the application. The `console` argument is an instance of the `Console` trait that is used to interact with the user. The `clientFactory` argument is a function that creates an instance of the `ErgoClient` class. \n\nThe `run` method does the following steps:\n1. Parses the command-line arguments using the `CmdLineParser.parseOptions` method.\n2. Loads the configuration file using the `loadConfig` method.\n3. Creates an instance of the `AppContext` class.\n4. Parses the command parameters using the `parseCmd` method.\n5. Executes the command using the `Cmd.run` method.\n\nThe `loadConfig` method loads the `ErgoToolConfig` from a file specified either by the command-line option `--conf` or from the default file location. The `parseCmd` method parses the command parameters from the command line using the `AppContext` class and returns a new instance of the command configured with the parsed parameters. \n\nThe `printUsage` method prints usage help to the console for the given command (if defined). If the command is not defined, then it prints basic usage info about all commands. \n\nIn summary, the `CliApplication` class provides a set of methods and properties that can be used by derived classes to create CLI applications. It handles parsing command-line arguments, loading configuration files, and executing commands. It also provides a set of default commands that can be overridden by derived classes.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `CliApplication` class?\n- The `CliApplication` class is the base class for all CLI applications in the Appkit Commands framework.\n\n2. What steps does the `run` method perform?\n- The `run` method performs the following steps: \n  1. Parse options from the command line.\n  2. Load the config file.\n  3. Create an `AppContext`.\n  4. Parse command parameters.\n  5. Create and execute the command.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `printUsage` method?\n- The `printUsage` method prints usage help to the console for a given command (if defined) or basic usage info about all commands if the command is not defined."
