  "summary": "The code above defines a package object called \"commands\" within the \"org.ergoplatform.appkit\" package. This package object contains a single method called \"usageError\". \n\nThe purpose of this method is to report usage errors to the ErgoTool. The ErgoTool is a command-line interface (CLI) tool that allows users to interact with the Ergo blockchain. The \"usageError\" method is designed to be called when the user has provided incorrect or invalid input to the ErgoTool. \n\nThe method takes two parameters: \"msg\" and \"cmdDescOpt\". \"msg\" is a string that contains the error message to be displayed to the user. \"cmdDescOpt\" is an optional parameter that contains a CmdDescriptor object. The CmdDescriptor object provides a description of the command that the user was attempting to execute when the error occurred. \n\nIf the \"usageError\" method is called, it will throw a UsageException. The UsageException is a custom exception that is defined elsewhere in the Ergo appkit project. This exception is designed to be caught by the ErgoTool, which will then display the error message to the user. \n\nHere is an example of how the \"usageError\" method might be used in the ErgoTool:\n\n```\nif (args.length < 2) {\n  commands.usageError(\"Not enough arguments provided.\", Some(cmdDescriptor))\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the ErgoTool is checking to see if the user has provided enough arguments to a particular command. If not, it calls the \"usageError\" method with an appropriate error message and a CmdDescriptor object that describes the command that the user was attempting to execute.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `commands` package object?\n   - The `commands` package object likely contains utility functions or constants related to the Ergo platform app kit.\n2. What does the `usageError` function do?\n   - The `usageError` function throws a `UsageException` with a given error message and optional command descriptor.\n3. What is the expected use case for the `usageError` function?\n   - The `usageError` function is likely intended to be used by the ErgoTool to report errors related to incorrect usage of the app kit."
