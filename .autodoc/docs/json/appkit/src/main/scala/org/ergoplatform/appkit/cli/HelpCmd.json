  "summary": "The code provided is a part of the ergo-appkit project and is located in the ergotool package. The purpose of this code is to provide a Help command that can be used to print usage help for a given command name. The Help command is implemented as a case class called HelpCmd, which takes three parameters: toolConf, name, and askedCmd. The toolConf parameter is an instance of ErgoToolConfig, which is used to configure the ErgoTool application. The name parameter is the name of the Help command, which is \"help\". The askedCmd parameter is the name of the command for which usage help should be printed.\n\nThe HelpCmd case class implements the run method, which takes an instance of AppContext as a parameter. The AppContext class provides access to the ErgoTool application context, which includes the list of available commands. The HelpCmd case class uses the commandsMap property of the AppContext class to look up the command with the given name. If the command is found, the printUsage method of the command is called to print the usage help. If the command is not found, an error message is printed.\n\nThe HelpCmd object provides a descriptor and parser for the Help command. The descriptor is an instance of the CmdDescriptor class, which provides information about the command, such as its name, syntax, and description. The parser is implemented as the createCmd method, which takes an instance of AppContext as a parameter and returns an instance of the HelpCmd case class. The createCmd method uses the cmdParameters property of the AppContext class to get the name of the command for which usage help should be printed.\n\nOverall, this code provides a useful Help command that can be used to get usage help for any command in the ErgoTool application. For example, to get usage help for the \"send\" command, the user can run the following command:\n\n```\nergotool help send\n```\n\nThis will print the usage help for the \"send\" command.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a HelpCmd class and a HelpCmd object that provide usage help for a given command name in the ergo-appkit project.\n\n2. What dependencies are required for this code to work?\n- This code requires dependencies from the org.ergoplatform.appkit.cli and org.ergoplatform.appkit.commands packages.\n\n3. How is the usage help printed for a given command name?\n- The run method of the HelpCmd class checks if the given command name exists in the commandsMap of the AppContext object and prints its usage help if it exists. Otherwise, it throws a CmdException with an error message."
