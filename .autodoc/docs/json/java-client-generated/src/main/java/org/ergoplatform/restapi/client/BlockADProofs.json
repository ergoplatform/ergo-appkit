  "summary": "The `BlockADProofs` class is part of the Ergo Node API and is used to model a block's AD (authenticated data) proofs. This class is generated automatically by the Swagger code generator program and should not be edited manually. \n\nThe `BlockADProofs` class has four properties: `headerId`, `proofBytes`, `digest`, and `size`. `headerId` is a string that represents the block header ID. `proofBytes` is a string that represents the serialized AD proof. `digest` is a string that represents the hash of the AD proof. `size` is an integer that represents the size of the AD proof in bytes. \n\nThis class provides getter and setter methods for each property, allowing users to access and modify the properties as needed. Additionally, the class provides methods for equality checking, hashing, and string representation. \n\nIn the larger Ergo Node API project, the `BlockADProofs` class is used to represent a block's AD proofs. This class can be used to serialize and deserialize AD proofs, as well as to perform equality checks and hashing. Other classes in the Ergo Node API may use the `BlockADProofs` class as a parameter or return type in their methods. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```java\nBlockADProofs adProofs = new BlockADProofs();\nadProofs.setHeaderId(\"12345\");\nadProofs.setProofBytes(\"abcdefg\");\nadProofs.setDigest(\"hash123\");\nadProofs.setSize(100);\n\nString headerId = adProofs.getHeaderId(); // returns \"12345\"\nString proofBytes = adProofs.getProofBytes(); // returns \"abcdefg\"\nString digest = adProofs.getDigest(); // returns \"hash123\"\nint size = adProofs.getSize(); // returns 100\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a Java class called `BlockADProofs` which represents a block's AD (authenticated data) proofs in the Ergo Node API.\n\n2. What are the required fields for a `BlockADProofs` object?\n- A `BlockADProofs` object requires a `headerId`, `proofBytes`, `digest`, and `size` field.\n\n3. Can the fields of a `BlockADProofs` object be modified after instantiation?\n- Yes, the fields of a `BlockADProofs` object can be modified using the provided setter methods."
