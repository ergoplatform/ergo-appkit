  "summary": "This code defines a Java class called `BlockReferencesInfo` which represents references to the previous and next blocks in a blockchain. The class has two private fields, `previousId` and `nextId`, which are both strings representing the IDs of the previous and next blocks respectively. The class has getter and setter methods for both fields, allowing other classes to access and modify the values of these fields.\n\nThe class also includes methods for equality checking, hashing, and string representation. These methods are used to compare instances of the `BlockReferencesInfo` class for equality, generate hash codes for instances of the class, and convert instances of the class to string representations, respectively.\n\nThis class is likely used in the larger project to represent the references to previous and next blocks in a blockchain. Other classes in the project may use instances of this class to access and modify these references. For example, a class representing a block in the blockchain may use an instance of `BlockReferencesInfo` to store the references to the previous and next blocks in the chain.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nBlockReferencesInfo blockRefs = new BlockReferencesInfo();\nblockRefs.setPreviousId(\"12345\");\nblockRefs.setNextId(\"67890\");\n\nSystem.out.println(blockRefs.getPreviousId()); // Output: 12345\nSystem.out.println(blockRefs.getNextId()); // Output: 67890\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a Java class called `BlockReferencesInfo` that contains information about the previous and next blocks in a blockchain.\n\n2. What are the required fields for an instance of this class?\n- An instance of this class requires a `previousId` field, which is the ID of the previous block.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `hashCode()` method in this class?\n- The `hashCode()` method is used to generate a hash code for an instance of this class, which can be used for various purposes such as storing objects in a hash table."
