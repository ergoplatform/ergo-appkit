  "summary": "The code defines a Java class called `ScanningPredicate` which is used in the Ergo Node API. The purpose of this class is to represent a scanning predicate, which is a string that specifies a condition that must be met in order for a transaction to be included in a block. The `ScanningPredicate` class has a single field called `predicate` which is a string that represents the scanning predicate.\n\nThe class has a constructor that takes no arguments, and a `predicate` method that takes a string argument and sets the `predicate` field to that value. The class also has a `getPredicate` method that returns the value of the `predicate` field.\n\nThe class overrides the `equals`, `hashCode`, and `toString` methods. The `equals` method compares two `ScanningPredicate` objects for equality based on the value of their `predicate` fields. The `hashCode` method returns a hash code for the `ScanningPredicate` object based on the value of its `predicate` field. The `toString` method returns a string representation of the `ScanningPredicate` object, including the value of its `predicate` field.\n\nThis class is used in the Ergo Node API to specify a scanning predicate when querying the blockchain for transactions. For example, the following code snippet shows how to create a `ScanningPredicate` object and use it to query the blockchain for transactions that meet the specified condition:\n\n```\nScanningPredicate predicate = new ScanningPredicate();\npredicate.predicate(\"INPUTS.size > 2\");\n\nList<Transaction> transactions = api.getTransactionsByScanPredicate(predicate);\n```\n\nIn this example, a `ScanningPredicate` object is created with the condition `INPUTS.size > 2`. This condition specifies that the transaction must have more than two inputs in order to be included in the result set. The `getTransactionsByScanPredicate` method is then called on the Ergo Node API with the `ScanningPredicate` object as an argument. This method returns a list of `Transaction` objects that meet the specified condition.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a Java class called `ScanningPredicate` which has a single property called `predicate`.\n\n2. What is the expected input for the `predicate` property?\n- The `predicate` property is marked as required and is expected to be a string.\n\n3. Why is there a `toString()` method in this class?\n- The `toString()` method is used to convert an instance of the `ScanningPredicate` class to a string representation. This is useful for debugging and logging purposes."
