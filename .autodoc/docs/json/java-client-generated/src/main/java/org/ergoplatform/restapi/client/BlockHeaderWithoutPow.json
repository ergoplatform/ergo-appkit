  "summary": "The `BlockHeaderWithoutPow` class is part of the Ergo Node API and is used to model block headers without proof-of-work (PoW) information. This class is generated automatically by the Swagger code generator program and should not be edited manually.\n\nThe class contains fields that represent various properties of a block header, such as the block ID, timestamp, version, and root hashes of the ad proofs, state, and transactions. It also includes fields for the block's difficulty, height, and parent ID, as well as the size and IDs of the block's extension, transactions, and ad proofs.\n\nThe class provides getter and setter methods for each field, allowing developers to easily access and modify the properties of a block header. For example, to get the ID of a block header, you can call the `getId()` method:\n\n```\nBlockHeaderWithoutPow header = new BlockHeaderWithoutPow();\nString id = header.getId();\n```\n\nTo set the timestamp of a block header, you can call the `setTimestamp()` method:\n\n```\nBlockHeaderWithoutPow header = new BlockHeaderWithoutPow();\nheader.setTimestamp(123456789);\n```\n\nThe class also includes methods for equality checking, hashing, and string representation.\n\nOverall, the `BlockHeaderWithoutPow` class is an important part of the Ergo Node API and is used to represent block headers without PoW information. It provides a convenient way for developers to work with block headers and access their properties.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code is a model for the BlockHeaderWithoutPow API in the Ergo Node API project.\n\n2. What are the required fields for a BlockHeaderWithoutPow object?\n- The required fields for a BlockHeaderWithoutPow object are id, timestamp, version, adProofsRoot, stateRoot, transactionsRoot, nBits, height, difficulty, parentId, and votes.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the equals, hashCode, and toString methods?\n- The equals method compares two BlockHeaderWithoutPow objects for equality, the hashCode method generates a hash code for the object, and the toString method returns a string representation of the object."
