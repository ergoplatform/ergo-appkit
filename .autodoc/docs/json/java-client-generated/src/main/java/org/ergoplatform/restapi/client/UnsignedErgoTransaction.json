  "summary": "The `UnsignedErgoTransaction` class is part of the Ergo Node API and is used to represent an unsigned Ergo transaction. This class is generated automatically by the Swagger code generator program and should not be edited manually. \n\nThe purpose of this class is to provide a model for an unsigned Ergo transaction that can be used by other parts of the Ergo platform. It contains four fields: `id`, `inputs`, `dataInputs`, and `outputs`. \n\nThe `id` field is a string that represents the ID of the transaction. The `inputs` field is a list of `ErgoTransactionUnsignedInput` objects that represent the unsigned inputs of the transaction. The `dataInputs` field is a list of `ErgoTransactionDataInput` objects that represent the data inputs of the transaction. Finally, the `outputs` field is a list of `ErgoTransactionOutput` objects that represent the outputs of the transaction.\n\nThis class can be used to create an unsigned Ergo transaction that can be signed and broadcasted to the Ergo network. Here is an example of how this class can be used:\n\n```\nUnsignedErgoTransaction transaction = new UnsignedErgoTransaction();\ntransaction.setId(\"12345\");\ntransaction.addInputsItem(new ErgoTransactionUnsignedInput());\ntransaction.addDataInputsItem(new ErgoTransactionDataInput());\ntransaction.addOutputsItem(new ErgoTransactionOutput());\n```\n\nIn this example, a new `UnsignedErgoTransaction` object is created and its `id`, `inputs`, `dataInputs`, and `outputs` fields are set. The `addInputsItem`, `addDataInputsItem`, and `addOutputsItem` methods are used to add new inputs, data inputs, and outputs to the transaction, respectively.\n\nOverall, the `UnsignedErgoTransaction` class provides a useful model for representing an unsigned Ergo transaction and can be used by other parts of the Ergo platform to create and broadcast transactions.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a Java class for an unsigned Ergo transaction, including its inputs, data inputs, and outputs.\n\n2. What dependencies does this code have?\n- This code depends on the Gson library for JSON serialization and deserialization, and the io.swagger.v3.oas.annotations library for OpenAPI annotations.\n\n3. Can the properties of an UnsignedErgoTransaction object be null?\n- Yes, the id, inputs, dataInputs, and outputs properties can all be null."
