  "summary": "The `HintExtractionRequest` class is part of the Ergo Node API and is used to request the extraction of prover hints from a transaction. The purpose of this class is to provide a container for the necessary information required to extract prover hints from a transaction. The class contains the following fields:\n\n- `tx`: an instance of the `ErgoTransaction` class that represents the transaction from which to extract the prover hints.\n- `real`: a list of `SigmaBoolean` objects that represent the real signers of the transaction.\n- `simulated`: a list of `SigmaBoolean` objects that represent the simulated signers of the transaction.\n- `inputsRaw`: an optional list of inputs to be used in serialized form.\n- `dataInputsRaw`: an optional list of data inputs to be used in serialized form.\n\nThe `HintExtractionRequest` class provides methods to set and get the values of these fields. For example, the `tx` field can be set using the `tx(ErgoTransaction tx)` method, and retrieved using the `getTx()` method.\n\nThis class is generated automatically by the Swagger code generator program and should not be edited manually. It is used in the larger Ergo Node API project to facilitate the extraction of prover hints from transactions. An example usage of this class might look like:\n\n```\nHintExtractionRequest request = new HintExtractionRequest();\nrequest.tx(tx);\nrequest.real(realSigners);\nrequest.simulated(simulatedSigners);\nrequest.inputsRaw(inputsRaw);\nrequest.dataInputsRaw(dataInputsRaw);\n```\n\nWhere `tx`, `realSigners`, `simulatedSigners`, `inputsRaw`, and `dataInputsRaw` are all variables representing the necessary information to extract prover hints from a transaction.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a Java class for a request to extract prover hints from a transaction in the Ergo Node API.\n\n2. What are the required parameters for creating an instance of the HintExtractionRequest class?\n- The required parameter is an instance of the ErgoTransaction class, which represents the transaction to extract prover hints from. \n\n3. What are the optional parameters for creating an instance of the HintExtractionRequest class?\n- The optional parameters are lists of SigmaBoolean objects representing the real and simulated signers of the transaction, as well as lists of serialized inputs and data inputs."
