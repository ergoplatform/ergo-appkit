  "summary": "This code defines a Java class called `PowSolutionInfo` that represents a data model for a proof-of-work solution. The class has four private fields: `pk`, `w`, `n`, and `d`, which are all strings. The `pk` field represents the public key of the miner who found the solution, while the `w`, `n`, and `d` fields are all hex-encoded strings that represent different parts of the solution.\n\nThe class provides getter and setter methods for each field, as well as an `equals` method that compares two `PowSolutionInfo` objects for equality based on their fields. It also provides a `toString` method that returns a string representation of the object.\n\nThis class is likely used in the larger project to represent proof-of-work solutions that are found by miners in the Ergo blockchain network. It may be used in conjunction with other classes and methods to validate and verify these solutions, as well as to store and retrieve them from a database or other data store.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nPowSolutionInfo solution = new PowSolutionInfo()\n    .pk(\"abc123\")\n    .w(\"deadbeef\")\n    .n(\"cafebab\")\n    .d(\"facefeed\");\n\nString pk = solution.getPk(); // \"abc123\"\nString w = solution.getW(); // \"deadbeef\"\nString n = solution.getN(); // \"cafebab\"\nString d = solution.getD(); // \"facefeed\"\n\nboolean isEqual = solution.equals(otherSolution); // true or false\nString solutionString = solution.toString(); // \"PowSolutionInfo { pk: abc123, w: deadbeef, n: cafebab, d: facefeed }\"\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a Java class called `PowSolutionInfo` which contains fields for miner public key, hex-encoded strings, and Autolykos.d.\n\n2. What is the expected input and output of this code?\n- This code does not have any input or output as it only defines a Java class.\n\n3. What is the significance of the `@Schema` annotation in this code?\n- The `@Schema` annotation is used to provide a description of the fields in the `PowSolutionInfo` class for documentation purposes."
