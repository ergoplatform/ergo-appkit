  "summary": "This code defines a Java class called `TotalBalance` which represents the total balance of a particular account in a cryptocurrency called Ergo. The class has two instance variables: `confirmed` and `unconfirmed`, both of which are of type `Balance`. The `Balance` class is defined in another file and is not shown here.\n\nThe `TotalBalance` class has two getter and setter methods for the `confirmed` and `unconfirmed` instance variables. These methods allow other parts of the code to access and modify the values of these variables.\n\nThe class also has several methods that are used for serialization and deserialization of JSON data. These methods are used to convert instances of the `TotalBalance` class to and from JSON format, which is a common data format used in web applications.\n\nOverall, this class is a simple data model that represents the total balance of an Ergo account. It can be used in other parts of the Ergo app to display the total balance of a user's account or to perform calculations on the total balance. For example, the following code snippet shows how an instance of the `TotalBalance` class can be created and initialized:\n\n```\nBalance confirmedBalance = new Balance(1000);\nBalance unconfirmedBalance = new Balance(500);\nTotalBalance totalBalance = new TotalBalance()\n    .confirmed(confirmedBalance)\n    .unconfirmed(unconfirmedBalance);\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a Java class called `TotalBalance` that represents the total balance of a cryptocurrency wallet, including both confirmed and unconfirmed balances.\n\n2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?\n- This code uses the `com.google.gson` and `io.swagger.v3.oas` libraries for JSON serialization and deserialization, and for OpenAPI schema annotations.\n\n3. What is the expected input and output of this code?\n- This code expects input in the form of JSON data that conforms to the `TotalBalance` schema, and outputs an instance of the `TotalBalance` class that contains the confirmed and unconfirmed balances."
