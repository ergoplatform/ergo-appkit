  "summary": "The `ApiKeyAuth` class is responsible for adding an API key to outgoing HTTP requests. It implements the `Interceptor` interface from the OkHttp library, which allows it to intercept and modify requests before they are sent. \n\nThe class takes two arguments in its constructor: `location` and `paramName`. `location` specifies where the API key should be added - either as a query parameter or a header. `paramName` specifies the name of the query parameter or header that should be used to send the API key.\n\nThe API key itself is stored as a private field in the class, and can be set using the `setApiKey` method. The `getApiKey` method can be used to retrieve the current API key.\n\nThe `intercept` method is where the actual modification of the request takes place. If the `location` is set to \"query\", the API key is added as a query parameter to the request URL. If the URL already has a query string, the API key is appended as an additional parameter. If the `location` is set to \"header\", the API key is added as a header to the request.\n\nThis class can be used in the larger project to authenticate requests to an API that requires an API key. By adding an instance of this class to an OkHttp client, all outgoing requests will automatically include the API key. For example:\n\n```\nOkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient.Builder()\n        .addInterceptor(new ApiKeyAuth(\"header\", \"X-Api-Key\"))\n        .build();\n\nRequest request = new Request.Builder()\n        .url(\"https://api.example.com/some-endpoint\")\n        .build();\n\nResponse response = client.newCall(request).execute();\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n    \n    This code defines a class called `ApiKeyAuth` that implements the `Interceptor` interface from the OkHttp library. It is used to add an API key to outgoing HTTP requests either as a query parameter or a header.\n\n2. What parameters does the `ApiKeyAuth` constructor take?\n    \n    The `ApiKeyAuth` constructor takes two parameters: `location`, which is a string indicating whether the API key should be added as a query parameter or a header, and `paramName`, which is a string indicating the name of the query parameter or header that the API key should be added to.\n\n3. What does the `intercept` method do?\n    \n    The `intercept` method is called by OkHttp when an HTTP request is being sent. It checks the `location` parameter to determine whether the API key should be added as a query parameter or a header, and then modifies the request accordingly. If the `location` is \"query\", it adds the API key as a query parameter to the request URL. If the `location` is \"header\", it adds the API key as a header to the request."
