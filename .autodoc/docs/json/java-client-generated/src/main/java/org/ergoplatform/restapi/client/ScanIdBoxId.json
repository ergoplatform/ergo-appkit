  "summary": "The `ScanIdBoxId` class is a model class that represents a combination of a scan ID and a box ID. It is used in the Ergo Node API to provide a unique identifier for a box that has been scanned. \n\nThe class has two private instance variables: `scanId` and `boxId`. `scanId` is an integer that represents the ID of the scan that the box was a part of, while `boxId` is a string that represents the ID of the box itself. \n\nThe class provides getter and setter methods for both instance variables, as well as an `equals` method that compares two `ScanIdBoxId` objects for equality based on their `scanId` and `boxId` values. It also provides a `hashCode` method for generating a hash code based on the `scanId` and `boxId` values, and a `toString` method for generating a string representation of the object.\n\nThis class is used in other parts of the Ergo Node API to uniquely identify scanned boxes. For example, it may be used in a request to retrieve information about a specific box that has been scanned, or to update the status of a box that has been scanned. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nScanIdBoxId scanIdBoxId = new ScanIdBoxId();\nscanIdBoxId.setScanId(123);\nscanIdBoxId.setBoxId(\"abc123\");\n\nSystem.out.println(scanIdBoxId.getScanId()); // Output: 123\nSystem.out.println(scanIdBoxId.getBoxId()); // Output: abc123\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a Java class called `ScanIdBoxId` which has two properties: `scanId` and `boxId`.\n\n2. What is the expected input and output of this code?\n- The input is an integer `scanId` and a string `boxId`. The output is an instance of the `ScanIdBoxId` class with the `scanId` and `boxId` properties set.\n\n3. Can the `scanId` and `boxId` properties be null?\n- The `scanId` property cannot be null as it is marked as required in the `@Schema` annotation. The `boxId` property is not marked as required and can be null."
