  "summary": "This code defines a Java class called `BlockSummary` that represents a summary of a block in the Ergo blockchain. The class has two properties: `block` and `references`, both of which are objects of other classes (`FullBlockInfo` and `BlockReferencesInfo`, respectively). \n\nThe `FullBlockInfo` class represents detailed information about a block, while the `BlockReferencesInfo` class represents information about the block's references to other blocks in the blockchain. \n\nThe `BlockSummary` class provides getter and setter methods for both properties, allowing other parts of the code to access and modify them. The class also overrides the `equals`, `hashCode`, and `toString` methods for proper comparison and string representation of `BlockSummary` objects.\n\nThis class is likely used in the larger Ergo Explorer API project to provide a high-level summary of a block's information, including its references to other blocks. Other parts of the project can use this class to easily access and manipulate this information. For example, a method in another class might take a `BlockSummary` object as a parameter and use its `getBlock()` method to access the detailed information about the block. \n\nHere is an example of how this class might be used in another part of the project:\n\n```\npublic void printBlockSummary(BlockSummary blockSummary) {\n    System.out.println(\"Block summary:\");\n    System.out.println(\"Block info: \" + blockSummary.getBlock());\n    System.out.println(\"References: \" + blockSummary.getReferences());\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a Java class called `BlockSummary` that contains a `FullBlockInfo` object and a `BlockReferencesInfo` object.\n\n2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?\n- This code uses the `com.google.gson` and `io.swagger.v3.oas.annotations` libraries.\n\n3. What is the expected input and output of this code?\n- This code does not have any input or output, as it only defines a Java class. However, the `BlockSummary` class can be used as a data model for other parts of the `ergo-appkit` project that deal with blocks and their references."
