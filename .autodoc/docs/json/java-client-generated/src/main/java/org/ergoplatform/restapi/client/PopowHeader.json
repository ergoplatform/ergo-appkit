  "summary": "The `PopowHeader` class is a model class that represents a header for a Proof of Proof of Work (PoPoW) block in the Ergo blockchain. It contains two fields: `header` and `interlinks`. The `header` field is an instance of the `BlockHeader` class, which represents the header of a block in the Ergo blockchain. The `interlinks` field is a list of strings that represents the interlinks of the PoPoW block.\n\nThe purpose of this class is to provide a standardized way of representing PoPoW headers in the Ergo blockchain. It can be used by other classes in the Ergo Appkit project that need to work with PoPoW headers. For example, it could be used by a class that verifies PoPoW proofs for Ergo blocks.\n\nHere is an example of how this class could be used:\n\n```\n// Create a new PoPoW header\nBlockHeader header = new BlockHeader();\nPopowHeader popowHeader = new PopowHeader();\npopowHeader.setHeader(header);\n\n// Add interlinks to the PoPoW header\nList<String> interlinks = new ArrayList<String>();\ninterlinks.add(\"interlink1\");\ninterlinks.add(\"interlink2\");\npopowHeader.setInterlinks(interlinks);\n\n// Print the PoPoW header\nSystem.out.println(popowHeader.toString());\n```\n\nThis would output the following:\n\n```\nclass PopowHeader {\n    header: BlockHeader@<hash>,\n    interlinks: [interlink1, interlink2]\n}\n```\n\nOverall, the `PopowHeader` class provides a simple and standardized way of representing PoPoW headers in the Ergo blockchain, which can be used by other classes in the Ergo Appkit project.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code is a Java class for the PopowHeader model in the Ergo Node API, which includes a BlockHeader and an array of interlinks.\n\n2. What is the significance of the @Schema annotation?\n- The @Schema annotation is used to provide metadata about the PopowHeader class, including a description of the header and interlinks properties.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the equals() and hashCode() methods?\n- The equals() and hashCode() methods are used to compare two PopowHeader objects for equality based on their header and interlinks properties."
