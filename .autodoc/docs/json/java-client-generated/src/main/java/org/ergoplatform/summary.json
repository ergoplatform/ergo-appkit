These formats include CSV, SSV, TSV, and PIPES. \n\nThe `CSVParams`, `SSVParams`, `TSVParams`, and `PIPESParams` classes are all subclasses of the `CollectionFormats` class. Each of these subclasses has a `toString()` method that formats the list of strings into the corresponding format. \n\nThe `CSVParams` class formats the list of strings into a comma-separated value format. The `SSVParams` class formats the list of strings into a space-separated value format. The `TSVParams` class formats the list of strings into a tab-separated value format. The `PIPESParams` class formats the list of strings into a pipe-separated value format. \n\nEach of these subclasses has three constructors: a default constructor, a constructor that takes a list of strings, and a constructor that takes a variable number of string arguments. The `getParams()` and `setParams()` methods are used to get and set the list of strings that will be formatted. \n\nThis code can be used in the larger project to format collections of strings into various formats for use in different parts of the application. For example, if the application needs to output data in a CSV format, the `CSVParams` class can be used to format the data. Similarly, if the application needs to output data in a different format, such as a space-separated value format, the `SSVParams` class can be used. \n\nHere is an example of how the `CSVParams` class can be used to format a list of strings:\n\n```\nList<String> params = Arrays.asList(\"param1\", \"param2\", \"param3\");\nCSVParams csvParams = new CSVParams(params);\nString formattedParams = csvParams.toString();\n```\n\nIn this example, a list of strings is created and passed to the `CSVParams` constructor. The `toString()` method is then called on the `csvParams` object to format the list of strings into a CSV format. The resulting string, `formattedParams`, can then be used in the application as needed.",

What are the differences between the `CSVParams`, `SSVParams`, `TSVParams`, and `PIPESParams` classes?\n    \n    Each of these classes extends the `CSVParams` class and overrides the `toString()` method to define a different delimiter for joining the list of strings. `SSVParams` uses a space delimiter, `TSVParams` uses a tab delimiter, and `PIPESParams` uses a pipe delimiter.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `StringUtil` class?\n    \n    The `StringUtil` class is not included in this code snippet, so a smart developer might wonder what it does and where it is defined. It is likely a utility class that provides string manipulation methods, such as `join()`, which is used in the `toString()` methods of the nested classes to join the list of strings with a delimiter."

For example:\n\n```java\nList<String> params = Arrays.asList(\"param1\", \"param2\", \"param3\");\nCSVParams csvParams = new CSVParams(params);\nString formattedParams = csvParams.toString();\n```\n\n`DefaultApi.java` is an interface that provides methods for interacting with the Ergo blockchain explorer API, such as fetching balances, transactions, blocks, and tokens. It serves as a bridge between the Ergo blockchain explorer API and the ergo-appkit project. For example:\n\n```java\nDefaultApi api = new DefaultApi();\nString address = \"9f4QF8AD1nQ3nJahQVkM6c5jmBvG4Df6MAzvp8uss6R4XNt8vGt\";\nApiResponse<ConfirmedBalance> response = api.getApiV1AddressesP1BalanceConfirmed(address, 10);\n```\n\n`ExplorerApiClient.java` is a wrapper around the Retrofit library, providing a convenient way to interact with a RESTful API. It offers methods to configure the Retrofit instance and handle deserialization failures. For example:\n\n```java\nExplorerApiClient client = new ExplorerApiClient();\nclient.createDefaultAdapter();\nDefaultApi api = client.createService(DefaultApi.class);\n```\n\n`JSON.java` is responsible for creating and configuring a `Gson` object, which is used to serialize and deserialize Java objects to and from JSON. It contains nested classes that extend `TypeAdapter` to customize the serialization and deserialization of specific Java types. For example:\n\n```java\nGson gson = new JSON().createGson();\nString jsonString = \"{\\\"name\\\":\\\"John\\\",\\\"age\\\":30}\";\nPerson person = gson.fromJson(jsonString, Person.class);\n```\n\n`StringUtil.java` provides utility methods for working with arrays of strings, such as `containsIgnoreCase` and `join`. These methods can be used throughout the project to simplify string manipulation tasks. For example:\n\n```java\nString[] names = {\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\"};\nString commaSeparatedNames = StringUtil.join(names, \", \");\n```\n\nThe `auth` subfolder contains classes for adding authentication information to HTTP requests made by the Ergo Explorer client. `ApiKeyAuth` adds an API key to requests, while `HttpBasicAuth` adds HTTP Basic Authentication headers. These classes can be used with an `OkHttpClient` instance to ensure that all requests include the necessary authentication information. For example:\n\n```java\nApiKeyAuth apiKeyAuth = new ApiKeyAuth(\"header\", \"X-Api-Key\");\napiKeyAuth.setApiKey(\"my-api-key\");\n\nOkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient.Builder()\n        .addInterceptor(apiKeyAuth)\n        .build();\n```\n\nOverall, this folder provides essential components for interacting with the Ergo blockchain explorer API, handling JSON serialization and deserialization, formatting collections of strings, and adding authentication information to HTTP requests.",

      "summary": "The `.autodoc/docs/json/java-client-generated/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/restapi` folder contains the Java classes that are generated from the Ergo Platform REST API specification. These classes are used to interact with the Ergo blockchain through the REST API, allowing developers to easily integrate Ergo functionality into their Java applications.\n\n### Files\n\n1. `ApiClient.java`: This file contains the `ApiClient` class, which is responsible for managing the communication with the Ergo REST API. It handles HTTP requests, authentication, and serialization/deserialization of JSON data.\n\n2. `ApiException.java`: This file contains the `ApiException` class, which is a custom exception class used to handle errors that occur during API calls. It provides detailed information about the error, such as the HTTP status code and the error message.\n\n3. `Configuration.java`: This file contains the `Configuration` class, which is used to configure the `ApiClient`. It allows developers to set various options, such as the API base path, authentication credentials, and timeouts.\n\n4. `GsonAdaptersModel.java`: This file contains the `GsonAdaptersModel` class, which is used to register custom Gson type adapters for the serialization and deserialization of JSON data. This ensures that the Java classes can be correctly mapped to the JSON data returned by the Ergo REST API.\n\n5. `Pair.java`: This file contains the `Pair` class, which is a simple utility class used to store a pair of values. It is used internally by the `ApiClient` class to manage query parameters and form data.\n\n6. `ProgressRequestBody.java` and `ProgressResponseBody.java`: These files contain the `ProgressRequestBody` and `ProgressResponseBody` classes, which are used to monitor the progress of file uploads and downloads during API calls. They extend the OkHttp `RequestBody` and `ResponseBody` classes and provide progress callbacks.\n\n### Usage\n\nTo use the Java client generated from the Ergo REST API, you would first create an instance of the `ApiClient` class and configure it using the `Configuration` class. For example:\n\n```java\nConfiguration config = new Configuration();\nconfig.setApiKey(\"your_api_key\");\nconfig.setBasePath(\"https://api.ergoplatform.com\");\n\nApiClient apiClient = new ApiClient(config);\n```\n\nNext, you would use the `ApiClient` instance to make API calls. For example, to get the balance of an address:\n\n```java\nString address = \"9f4QF8AD1nQ3nJahQVkM6c8qiuyhM1i8Kgh8Dt6hP8Xf8gsgg5u\";\nApiResponse<Balance> response = apiClient.invokeAPI(\"/addresses/\" + address + \"/balance\", \"GET\", null, null, null, null, null, \"application/json\", null, new TypeToken<Balance>(){}.getType());\n\nBalance balance = response.getData();\nSystem.out.println(\"Balance: \" + balance.getConfirmed().getNanoErgs());\n```\n\nThis code snippet demonstrates how to configure the `ApiClient`, make an API call to get the balance of an address, and extract the balance information from the response.",
