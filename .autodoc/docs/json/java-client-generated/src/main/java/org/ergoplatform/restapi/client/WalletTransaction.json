  "summary": "The `WalletTransaction` class is part of the `ergo-appkit` project and is used to represent a transaction with additional information. This class is generated automatically by the Swagger code generator program and should not be edited manually. \n\nThe `WalletTransaction` class has several properties that describe a transaction, including `id`, `inputs`, `dataInputs`, `outputs`, `inclusionHeight`, `numConfirmations`, `scans`, and `size`. \n\nThe `id` property is a string that uniquely identifies the transaction. The `inputs` property is a list of `ErgoTransactionInput` objects that represent the inputs to the transaction. The `dataInputs` property is a list of `ErgoTransactionDataInput` objects that represent the data inputs to the transaction. The `outputs` property is a list of `ErgoTransactionOutput` objects that represent the outputs of the transaction. \n\nThe `inclusionHeight` property is an integer that represents the height of the block in which the transaction was included. The `numConfirmations` property is an integer that represents the number of confirmations the transaction has received. The `scans` property is a list of integers that represent the scan identifiers the transaction relates to. Finally, the `size` property is an integer that represents the size of the transaction in bytes.\n\nThis class can be used to represent a transaction in the Ergo blockchain and can be used in conjunction with other classes in the `ergo-appkit` project to build applications that interact with the Ergo blockchain. For example, a developer could use this class to create a wallet application that displays transaction information to the user. \n\nHere is an example of how to create a `WalletTransaction` object:\n\n```\nErgoTransactionInput input = new ErgoTransactionInput();\nErgoTransactionDataInput dataInput = new ErgoTransactionDataInput();\nErgoTransactionOutput output = new ErgoTransactionOutput();\n\nList<ErgoTransactionInput> inputs = new ArrayList<>();\ninputs.add(input);\n\nList<ErgoTransactionDataInput> dataInputs = new ArrayList<>();\ndataInputs.add(dataInput);\n\nList<ErgoTransactionOutput> outputs = new ArrayList<>();\noutputs.add(output);\n\nWalletTransaction transaction = new WalletTransaction()\n    .id(\"transactionId\")\n    .inputs(inputs)\n    .dataInputs(dataInputs)\n    .outputs(outputs)\n    .inclusionHeight(20998)\n    .numConfirmations(1)\n    .scans(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3))\n    .size(100);\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a Java class called `WalletTransaction` that represents a transaction with additional information such as inclusion height, number of confirmations, and scan identifiers.\n\n2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?\n- This code uses the `com.google.gson` and `io.swagger.v3.oas.annotations` libraries.\n\n3. What are some of the key attributes and methods of the `WalletTransaction` class?\n- Some key attributes of the `WalletTransaction` class include `id`, `inputs`, `dataInputs`, `outputs`, `inclusionHeight`, `numConfirmations`, `scans`, and `size`. Some key methods include getters and setters for these attributes, as well as `addInputsItem()`, `addDataInputsItem()`, and `addOutputsItem()` methods for adding items to the corresponding lists."
