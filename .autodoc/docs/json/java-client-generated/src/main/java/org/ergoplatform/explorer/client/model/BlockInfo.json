  "summary": "The `BlockInfo` class is a model class that represents a block in the Ergo blockchain. It contains information about the block such as its ID, height, epoch, version, timestamp, number of transactions, miner information, size, difficulty, and miner reward. \n\nThis class is used to represent a block in the Ergo Explorer API v1, which is a RESTful API that provides access to information about the Ergo blockchain. The API allows developers to retrieve information about blocks, transactions, addresses, and other data related to the Ergo blockchain. \n\nDevelopers can use this class to deserialize JSON responses from the Ergo Explorer API v1 into Java objects. For example, the following code snippet shows how to deserialize a JSON response into a `BlockInfo` object using the Gson library:\n\n```\nGson gson = new Gson();\nBlockInfo blockInfo = gson.fromJson(jsonResponse, BlockInfo.class);\n```\n\nWhere `jsonResponse` is a string containing the JSON response from the Ergo Explorer API v1. \n\nOnce the JSON response is deserialized into a `BlockInfo` object, developers can access the information about the block using the getter methods provided by the class. For example, to get the ID of the block, developers can call the `getId()` method:\n\n```\nString blockId = blockInfo.getId();\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a Java class called `BlockInfo` which represents a block in the Ergo blockchain. It contains various properties of a block such as its ID, height, epoch, version, timestamp, transactions count, miner information, size, difficulty, and miner reward.\n\n2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?\n- This code uses the `com.google.gson` library for JSON serialization and deserialization, and the `io.swagger.v3.oas.annotations` package for OpenAPI annotations.\n\n3. Can the properties of a `BlockInfo` object be modified after it is created?\n- Yes, the `BlockInfo` class provides setter methods for all of its properties, so they can be modified after the object is created."
