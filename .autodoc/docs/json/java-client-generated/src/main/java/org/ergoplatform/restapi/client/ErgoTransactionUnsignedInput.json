  "summary": "The `ErgoTransactionUnsignedInput` class is part of the Ergo Node API and is used to represent an unsigned input in an Ergo transaction. The class has two fields: `boxId` and `extension`. \n\nThe `boxId` field is a required string that represents the ID of the box that is being spent as an input in the transaction. \n\nThe `extension` field is an optional map of key-value pairs that can be used to include additional information about the input. The keys and values in the map are both strings. \n\nThe class provides getter and setter methods for both fields, as well as a convenience method `putExtensionItem` for adding items to the `extension` map. \n\nThis class is generated automatically by the Swagger code generator program and should not be edited manually. It can be used in conjunction with other classes in the Ergo Node API to build and submit Ergo transactions. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nErgoTransactionUnsignedInput input = new ErgoTransactionUnsignedInput()\n    .boxId(\"1234567890abcdef\")\n    .putExtensionItem(\"key1\", \"value1\")\n    .putExtensionItem(\"key2\", \"value2\");\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a Java class called `ErgoTransactionUnsignedInput` that represents an unsigned input for an Ergo transaction.\n\n2. What dependencies does this code have?\n- This code depends on the `com.google.gson` and `io.swagger.v3.oas.annotations` libraries.\n\n3. Can the `extension` field be null?\n- Yes, the `extension` field can be null."
