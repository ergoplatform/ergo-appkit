  "summary": "This code defines a Java class called `NotFound` that represents a response object returned by the Ergo Explorer API. The `NotFound` class has two properties: `status` and `reason`, both of which are serialized using the Gson library. The `status` property is an integer that represents the HTTP status code of the response, while the `reason` property is a string that provides a human-readable explanation of why the requested resource was not found.\n\nThis class is used in the Ergo Explorer API to provide a standardized response format for requests that result in a 404 Not Found error. By using this class, the API can ensure that clients receive a consistent response format regardless of the specific resource that was not found.\n\nHere is an example of how this class might be used in the larger Ergo Explorer project:\n\n```java\nimport org.ergoplatform.explorer.client.api.NotFoundException;\nimport org.ergoplatform.explorer.client.api.ExplorerApi;\nimport org.ergoplatform.explorer.client.model.NotFound;\n\nExplorerApi api = new ExplorerApi();\ntry {\n    // Make a request to the API to retrieve a resource that does not exist\n    api.getResource(\"nonexistent-resource\");\n} catch (NotFoundException e) {\n    // Handle the 404 Not Found error by parsing the response body as a NotFound object\n    NotFound notFound = e.getResponseBody();\n    System.out.println(\"Resource not found: \" + notFound.getReason());\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `ExplorerApi` class is used to make a request to the Ergo Explorer API to retrieve a resource that does not exist. If the API returns a 404 Not Found error, the `NotFoundException` is caught and the response body is parsed as a `NotFound` object. The `reason` property of the `NotFound` object is then used to provide a user-friendly error message to the client.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a Java class called `NotFound` that represents a response object for a 404 error.\n\n2. What dependencies does this code have?\n- This code depends on the `com.google.gson` and `io.swagger.v3.oas.annotations` packages.\n\n3. Can this code be modified manually?\n- No, this code should not be edited manually as it is auto-generated by the Swagger Codegen program."
