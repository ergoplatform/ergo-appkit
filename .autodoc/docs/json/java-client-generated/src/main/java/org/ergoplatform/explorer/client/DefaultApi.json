  "summary": "The `DefaultApi` interface in the `org.ergoplatform.explorer.client` package provides a set of methods for interacting with the Ergo blockchain explorer API. This interface is used to fetch various types of data from the Ergo blockchain, such as balances, transactions, blocks, and tokens.\n\nFor example, the `getApiV1AddressesP1BalanceConfirmed` method retrieves the confirmed balance of a given address with an optional minimum number of confirmations. Similarly, the `getApiV1AddressesP1Transactions` method fetches the transactions associated with a specific address, with optional parameters for pagination and concise output.\n\nThe interface also provides methods for fetching data related to blocks, such as `getApiV1Blocks` which retrieves a list of blocks with optional pagination and sorting parameters, and `getApiV1BlocksP1` which fetches the summary of a specific block.\n\nToken-related methods include `getApiV1Tokens` which retrieves a list of tokens with optional pagination, sorting, and filtering parameters, and `getApiV1TokensP1` which fetches the information of a specific token.\n\nAdditionally, there are methods for searching and filtering data, such as `postApiV1BoxesSearch` which allows searching for boxes based on a `BoxQuery` object, and `getApiV1TransactionsByinputsscripttemplatehashP1` which fetches transactions based on an input script template hash.\n\nOverall, the `DefaultApi` interface serves as a bridge between the Ergo blockchain explorer API and the ergo-appkit project, allowing developers to easily fetch and interact with data from the Ergo blockchain.",
  "questions": "1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `DefaultApi` interface?\n   **Answer**: The `DefaultApi` interface defines the API endpoints and their corresponding methods for interacting with the Ergo Explorer API. It uses Retrofit2 library to make HTTP requests and handle responses.\n\n2. **Question**: How are the API endpoints defined in the `DefaultApi` interface?\n   **Answer**: The API endpoints are defined using Retrofit2 annotations such as `@GET`, `@POST`, and `@Headers`. These annotations specify the HTTP method, the endpoint URL, and any additional headers required for the request.\n\n3. **Question**: How are the query parameters and path parameters handled in the `DefaultApi` interface methods?\n   **Answer**: The query parameters and path parameters are handled using Retrofit2 annotations such as `@retrofit2.http.Path`, `@retrofit2.http.Query`, and `@retrofit2.http.Body`. These annotations are used to define the parameters in the method signature and map them to the corresponding parts of the API endpoint URL or request body."
