  "summary": "The `RequestsHolder` class is part of the Ergo Node API and is used to hold multiple transaction requests and a transaction fee. This class is generated automatically by the Swagger code generator program and should not be edited manually. \n\nThe `RequestsHolder` class has four properties: `requests`, `fee`, `inputsRaw`, and `dataInputsRaw`. The `requests` property is a list of transaction requests, where each request is an instance of `AnyOfRequestsHolderRequestsItems`. The `fee` property is the transaction fee, represented as a `Long`. The `inputsRaw` property is a list of inputs to be used in serialized form, and the `dataInputsRaw` property is a list of data inputs to be used in serialized form. \n\nThe `RequestsHolder` class provides methods to set and get the values of its properties. The `requests` property can be set using the `requests` method, which takes a list of `AnyOfRequestsHolderRequestsItems` as an argument. The `addRequestsItem` method can be used to add a single `AnyOfRequestsHolderRequestsItems` to the `requests` list. The `fee` property can be set using the `fee` method, which takes a `Long` as an argument. The `inputsRaw` property can be set using the `inputsRaw` method, which takes a list of `String`s as an argument. The `addInputsRawItem` method can be used to add a single `String` to the `inputsRaw` list. The `dataInputsRaw` property can be set using the `dataInputsRaw` method, which takes a list of `String`s as an argument. The `addDataInputsRawItem` method can be used to add a single `String` to the `dataInputsRaw` list. \n\nOverall, the `RequestsHolder` class is used to hold multiple transaction requests and a transaction fee, along with lists of inputs and data inputs in serialized form. This class is likely used in the larger Ergo Node API project to facilitate the creation and submission of multiple transactions at once. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nRequestsHolder requestsHolder = new RequestsHolder();\nrequestsHolder.addRequestsItem(request1);\nrequestsHolder.addRequestsItem(request2);\nrequestsHolder.fee(1000000L);\nrequestsHolder.addInputsRawItem(input1);\nrequestsHolder.addInputsRawItem(input2);\nrequestsHolder.addDataInputsRawItem(dataInput1);\nrequestsHolder.addDataInputsRawItem(dataInput2);\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `RequestsHolder` class?\n- The `RequestsHolder` class holds many transaction requests and transaction fee.\n\n2. What are the possible values for the `requests` field?\n- The `requests` field is a sequence of transaction requests, and its possible values are instances of `AnyOfRequestsHolderRequestsItems`.\n\n3. Can the `inputsRaw` and `dataInputsRaw` fields be null?\n- Yes, both `inputsRaw` and `dataInputsRaw` fields can be null."
