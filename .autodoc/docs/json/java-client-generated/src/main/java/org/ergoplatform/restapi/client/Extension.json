  "summary": "The `Extension` class is part of the Ergo Node API and is used to represent an extension in the Ergo blockchain. An extension is a piece of data that can be attached to a transaction or block in the blockchain. \n\nThe `Extension` class has three properties: `headerId`, `digest`, and `fields`. The `headerId` property is a string that identifies the type of extension. The `digest` property is a string that represents the hash of the extension data. The `fields` property is a list of `KeyValueItem` objects, which represent key-value pairs of data that make up the extension.\n\nThe `Extension` class provides methods to get and set the values of its properties. The `getHeaderId()` method returns the value of the `headerId` property, the `getDigest()` method returns the value of the `digest` property, and the `getFields()` method returns the list of `KeyValueItem` objects in the `fields` property. The `setHeaderId()`, `setDigest()`, and `setFields()` methods are used to set the values of the `headerId`, `digest`, and `fields` properties, respectively. The `addFieldsItem()` method is used to add a `KeyValueItem` object to the `fields` list.\n\nThe `Extension` class also provides methods to override the `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` methods. The `equals()` method compares two `Extension` objects for equality based on their `headerId`, `digest`, and `fields` properties. The `hashCode()` method returns a hash code for an `Extension` object based on its `headerId`, `digest`, and `fields` properties. The `toString()` method returns a string representation of an `Extension` object.\n\nIn the larger Ergo Node API project, the `Extension` class is used to represent extensions in the Ergo blockchain. It can be used to create, read, update, and delete extensions in the blockchain. For example, to create a new extension, a new `Extension` object can be created and its properties can be set using the `setHeaderId()`, `setDigest()`, and `addFieldsItem()` methods. The `Extension` object can then be added to a transaction or block in the blockchain.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code is part of the Ergo Node API and defines a Java class called Extension that contains a headerId, digest, and a list of key-value records.\n\n2. What is the expected input and output of this code?\n- The input is a set of values for the headerId, digest, and fields of an Extension object. The output is an Extension object with those values.\n\n3. What is the significance of the @SerializedName and @Schema annotations?\n- The @SerializedName annotation is used to specify the name of the JSON property that corresponds to a Java field. The @Schema annotation is used to define metadata about a field, such as whether it is required and its description."
