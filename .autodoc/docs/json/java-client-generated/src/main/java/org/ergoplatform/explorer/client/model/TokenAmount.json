  "summary": "This code defines a Java class called `TokenAmount` that represents a token and its associated amount. The class has four properties: `tokenId`, `amount`, `decimals`, and `name`. \n\n`tokenId` is a string that represents the unique identifier of the token. `amount` is a long integer that represents the amount of the token. `decimals` is an integer that represents the number of decimal places used to represent the token amount. `name` is a string that represents the name of the token.\n\nThe class also has getter and setter methods for each property, as well as methods for setting the properties in a fluent style. Additionally, the class overrides the `equals`, `hashCode`, and `toString` methods for object comparison and string representation.\n\nThis class is likely used in the larger project to represent token amounts in various contexts, such as in transactions or in user wallets. For example, a transaction object may contain one or more `TokenAmount` objects to represent the tokens being transferred. \n\nHere is an example of how this class might be used:\n\n```\nTokenAmount tokenAmount = new TokenAmount()\n    .tokenId(\"abc123\")\n    .amount(1000L)\n    .decimals(2)\n    .name(\"My Token\");\n\nSystem.out.println(tokenAmount.getAmount()); // Output: 1000\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a Java class called `TokenAmount` which represents a token with its ID, amount, number of decimals, and name.\n\n2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?\n- This code uses the `com.google.gson` and `io.swagger.v3.oas.annotations` libraries.\n\n3. Can the properties of a `TokenAmount` object be null?\n- Yes, the `name` property is not required and can be null."
