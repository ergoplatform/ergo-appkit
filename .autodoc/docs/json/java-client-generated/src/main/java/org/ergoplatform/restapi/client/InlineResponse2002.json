  "summary": "The code defines a Java class called `InlineResponse2002` which represents a response object for the Ergo Node API. The class has four fields: `isInitialized`, `isUnlocked`, `changeAddress`, and `walletHeight`. \n\nThe `isInitialized` field is a boolean value that indicates whether the wallet is initialized or not. The `isUnlocked` field is also a boolean value that indicates whether the wallet is unlocked or not. The `changeAddress` field is a string that represents the address to which change should be sent. If the wallet is not initialized or locked, this field is empty. The `walletHeight` field is an integer that represents the last scanned height for the wallet.\n\nThe class provides getter and setter methods for each field, as well as an `equals` method, a `hashCode` method, and a `toString` method. The `toString` method generates a string representation of the object, which includes the values of all four fields.\n\nThis class is likely used as a response object for API calls that retrieve information about the state of the wallet. For example, an API call to retrieve the wallet status might return an instance of this class with the `isInitialized` and `isUnlocked` fields set to `true` if the wallet is initialized and unlocked, respectively. The `changeAddress` field would contain the address to which change should be sent, and the `walletHeight` field would contain the last scanned height for the wallet. \n\nHere is an example of how this class might be used in an API call:\n\n```\nInlineResponse2002 response = api.getWalletStatus();\nSystem.out.println(\"Wallet initialized: \" + response.isIsInitialized());\nSystem.out.println(\"Wallet unlocked: \" + response.isIsUnlocked());\nSystem.out.println(\"Change address: \" + response.getChangeAddress());\nSystem.out.println(\"Wallet height: \" + response.getWalletHeight());\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a Java class called `InlineResponse2002` which represents a response object for the Ergo Node API.\n\n2. What are the properties of the `InlineResponse2002` class?\n- The `InlineResponse2002` class has four properties: `isInitialized`, `isUnlocked`, `changeAddress`, and `walletHeight`.\n\n3. What is the expected format of the `changeAddress` property?\n- The `changeAddress` property is expected to be a string representing an Ergo wallet address. It is empty when the wallet is not initialized or locked, and can be set via the `/wallet/updateChangeAddress` method."
