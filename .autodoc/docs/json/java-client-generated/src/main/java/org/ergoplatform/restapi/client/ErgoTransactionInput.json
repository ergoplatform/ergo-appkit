  "summary": "The `ErgoTransactionInput` class is part of the Ergo Node API and is used to represent an input to a transaction on the Ergo blockchain. It contains three fields: `boxId`, `spendingProof`, and `extension`. \n\nThe `boxId` field is a required string that represents the ID of the box being spent as an input to the transaction. The `spendingProof` field is also required and represents the proof that the transaction is authorized to spend the box. The `extension` field is an optional map of key-value pairs that can be used to include additional information about the input.\n\nThis class is generated automatically by the Swagger code generator program and should not be edited manually. It includes methods to set and get the values of the fields, as well as methods to add and retrieve items from the `extension` map.\n\nThis class can be used in conjunction with other classes in the Ergo Node API to build and submit transactions on the Ergo blockchain. For example, a `ErgoTransaction` object could be created that contains one or more `ErgoTransactionInput` objects, along with one or more `ErgoTransactionOutput` objects, to represent a complete transaction. The `ErgoTransaction` object could then be submitted to the Ergo Node API to be included in the blockchain.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nErgoTransactionInput input = new ErgoTransactionInput()\n    .boxId(\"1234567890abcdef\")\n    .spendingProof(new SpendingProof())\n    .putExtensionItem(\"key1\", \"value1\")\n    .putExtensionItem(\"key2\", \"value2\");\n\nErgoTransaction transaction = new ErgoTransaction()\n    .inputs(Arrays.asList(input))\n    .outputs(Arrays.asList(output))\n    .fee(1000000L);\n\nErgoApi api = new ErgoApi();\napi.submitTransaction(transaction);\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a Java class called `ErgoTransactionInput` that represents an input to an Ergo transaction, including the box ID, spending proof, and extension.\n\n2. What dependencies does this code have?\n- This code depends on the `com.google.gson` and `io.swagger.v3.oas.annotations` libraries.\n\n3. Can the `extension` field be null?\n- Yes, the `extension` field can be null. If it is not null, it is a map of string key-value pairs."
