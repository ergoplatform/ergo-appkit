  "summary": "The `Body2` class is a model class that represents a request body for a specific API endpoint in the Ergo Node API. The purpose of this class is to provide a structure for the request body that can be used to send data to the API endpoint. \n\nThe `Body2` class has two properties: `mnemonic` and `mnemonicPass`. The `mnemonic` property is a string that represents a mnemonic seed, which is an optional parameter. The `mnemonicPass` property is also a string that represents an optional password to protect the mnemonic seed. \n\nThis class provides getter and setter methods for both properties, which can be used to set and retrieve the values of these properties. Additionally, the class provides methods for equality checking, hashing, and string representation. \n\nThis class is generated automatically by the Swagger Codegen program and should not be edited manually. It is used in conjunction with other classes and methods in the Ergo Node API to provide a complete set of functionality for interacting with the Ergo blockchain. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```java\nBody2 body = new Body2();\nbody.setMnemonic(\"example mnemonic\");\nbody.setMnemonicPass(\"example password\");\n```\n\nIn this example, a new instance of the `Body2` class is created and the `mnemonic` and `mnemonicPass` properties are set using the provided setter methods. This instance can then be used as the request body for the API endpoint that requires this specific structure.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code is a model class for the Ergo Node API, specifically for the Body2 object.\n\n2. What is the significance of the @SerializedName and @Schema annotations?\n- The @SerializedName annotation is used to specify the name of the JSON property that corresponds to a field in the Java object. The @Schema annotation is used to provide additional information about the field, such as whether it is required or optional, and a description.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the equals and hashCode methods?\n- The equals and hashCode methods are used to compare two instances of the Body2 class for equality. They are generated automatically by the IDE and compare the mnemonic and mnemonicPass fields of the objects."
