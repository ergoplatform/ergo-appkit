  "summary": "The `BoxQuery` class is a model class that represents a query for a box in the Ergo blockchain. A box is a data structure that contains assets and registers, and is used to store and transfer value in the blockchain. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to search for boxes that meet certain criteria.\n\nThe class has four fields: `ergoTreeTemplateHash`, `registers`, `constants`, and `assets`. The `ergoTreeTemplateHash` field is a SHA-256 hash of the ErgoTree template that the box script should have. The `registers` field is a map of register IDs and register values that the box should contain. The `constants` field is a map of constant indices and constant values that the box should contain. The `assets` field is a list of token IDs that the box should contain.\n\nThe class provides methods to set and get the values of these fields. For example, the `ergoTreeTemplateHash` field can be set using the `ergoTreeTemplateHash` method, and retrieved using the `getErgoTreeTemplateHash` method. Similarly, the `registers` field can be set using the `registers` method, and retrieved using the `getRegisters` method.\n\nThis class is used in the larger Ergo Explorer API project to search for boxes that meet certain criteria. For example, a user might want to search for boxes that contain a certain token, or that have a certain register value. The `BoxQuery` class provides a way to specify these criteria in a structured way, and to pass them to the API for processing. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nBoxQuery query = new BoxQuery()\n    .ergoTreeTemplateHash(\"1234567890abcdef\")\n    .putRegistersItem(\"R1\", \"hello\")\n    .addAssetsItem(\"token1\")\n    .addAssetsItem(\"token2\");\n```\n\nThis creates a `BoxQuery` object with an ErgoTree template hash of \"1234567890abcdef\", a register value of \"hello\" for register R1, and two token IDs (\"token1\" and \"token2\").",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `BoxQuery` class?\n- The `BoxQuery` class is a model class that represents a query for a box in the Ergo blockchain.\n\n2. What are the different properties of a `BoxQuery` object?\n- A `BoxQuery` object has four properties: `ergoTreeTemplateHash`, `registers`, `constants`, and `assets`.\n\n3. What is the format of the `ergoTreeTemplateHash` property?\n- The `ergoTreeTemplateHash` property is a SHA-256 hash of the ErgoTree template that the box script should have."
