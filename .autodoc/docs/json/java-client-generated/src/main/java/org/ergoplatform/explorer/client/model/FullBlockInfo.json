  "summary": "This code defines a Java class called `FullBlockInfo` that represents a full block in the Ergo blockchain. The class has four instance variables: `header`, `blockTransactions`, `extension`, and `adProofs`. \n\nThe `header` variable is an instance of the `HeaderInfo` class, which contains information about the block header. The `blockTransactions` variable is a list of `TransactionInfo1` objects, which represent the transactions in the block. The `extension` variable is an instance of the `BlockExtensionInfo` class, which contains additional information about the block. The `adProofs` variable is a string that contains serialized hex-encoded AD Proofs.\n\nThe class provides getter and setter methods for each instance variable, as well as methods to add a `TransactionInfo1` object to the `blockTransactions` list and to convert the object to a string.\n\nThis class is likely used in the larger Ergo appkit project to represent full blocks in the Ergo blockchain. It can be used to retrieve information about a block's header, transactions, and extension, as well as its AD Proofs. For example, a developer could use this class to retrieve the header of the most recent block in the blockchain:\n\n```\nFullBlockInfo block = // retrieve the most recent block\nHeaderInfo header = block.getHeader();\n```\n\nOverall, this code provides a convenient way to represent and manipulate full blocks in the Ergo blockchain.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a Java class called `FullBlockInfo` which represents a full block information in the Ergo Explorer API.\n\n2. What are the properties of the `FullBlockInfo` class?\n- The `FullBlockInfo` class has four properties: `header` of type `HeaderInfo`, `blockTransactions` of type `List<TransactionInfo1>`, `extension` of type `BlockExtensionInfo`, and `adProofs` of type `String`.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `adProofs` property?\n- The `adProofs` property is a serialized hex-encoded AD Proofs, which is a cryptographic proof that a transaction was included in a block."
