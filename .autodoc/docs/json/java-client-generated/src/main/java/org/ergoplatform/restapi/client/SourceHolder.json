  "summary": "The `SourceHolder` class is a model class that represents a Sigma source to be compiled. It is used in the Ergo Node API to provide a way to pass Sigma source code to the server for compilation. \n\nThe class has a single field, `source`, which is a string representing the Sigma source code. The `source` field is annotated with `@Schema` to indicate that it is a required field for the API. The class also has a getter and setter method for the `source` field.\n\nThe `SourceHolder` class overrides the `equals`, `hashCode`, and `toString` methods to provide a way to compare instances of the class, generate a hash code for an instance, and generate a string representation of an instance, respectively.\n\nThis class is generated by the Swagger code generator program and should not be edited manually. It is used in the larger Ergo Node API project to provide a standardized way to pass Sigma source code to the server for compilation. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```java\nSourceHolder sourceHolder = new SourceHolder();\nsourceHolder.setSource(\"HEIGHT > 1000\");\nString source = sourceHolder.getSource(); // \"HEIGHT > 1000\"\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a Java class called `SourceHolder` which has a single field called `source` and methods to get and set its value.\n\n2. What is the expected input for the `source` field?\n- The `source` field is expected to contain a Sigma source code that will be compiled.\n\n3. Why is there a `toIndentedString` method in this class?\n- The `toIndentedString` method is used to convert an object to a string with each line indented by 4 spaces, which is useful for formatting output in a readable way. It is used in the `toString` method to format the output of the `SourceHolder` object."
