  "summary": "The `EmissionInfo` class is a model class that represents the emission information for a given height in the Ergo blockchain. It contains three fields: `minerReward`, `totalCoinsIssued`, and `totalRemainCoins`, which are all of type `Long`. \n\nThe `minerReward` field represents the reward that the miner of the block at the given height will receive. The `totalCoinsIssued` field represents the total number of coins that have been issued up to and including the given height. The `totalRemainCoins` field represents the total number of coins that remain to be issued after the given height.\n\nThis class is used in the Ergo Node API to provide information about the current state of the Ergo blockchain. It can be used by clients of the API to retrieve information about the current emission schedule of the Ergo blockchain, which can be useful for various purposes such as calculating the inflation rate of the Ergo coin.\n\nHere is an example of how this class might be used in the Ergo Node API:\n\n```java\nErgoApi ergoApi = new ErgoApi();\nEmissionInfo emissionInfo = ergoApi.getEmissionInfo(1000000);\nSystem.out.println(\"Miner reward at height 1000000: \" + emissionInfo.getMinerReward());\nSystem.out.println(\"Total coins issued at height 1000000: \" + emissionInfo.getTotalCoinsIssued());\nSystem.out.println(\"Total remain coins after height 1000000: \" + emissionInfo.getTotalRemainCoins());\n```\n\nIn this example, we create an instance of the `ErgoApi` class and use it to retrieve the emission information for height 1000000. We then print out the values of the `minerReward`, `totalCoinsIssued`, and `totalRemainCoins` fields of the `EmissionInfo` object.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a Java class called `EmissionInfo` which contains information about the emission of a cryptocurrency called Ergo.\n\n2. What are the properties of the `EmissionInfo` class?\n- The `EmissionInfo` class has three properties: `minerReward`, `totalCoinsIssued`, and `totalRemainCoins`, all of which are of type `Long`.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `toIndentedString` method?\n- The `toIndentedString` method is a private helper method that converts an object to a string with each line indented by 4 spaces, except for the first line. It is used in the `toString` method to format the output of the `EmissionInfo` class."
