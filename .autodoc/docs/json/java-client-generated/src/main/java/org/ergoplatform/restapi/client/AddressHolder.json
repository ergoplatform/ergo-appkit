  "summary": "The `AddressHolder` class is a model class that represents an encoded ErgoAddress. It is used in the Ergo Node API to hold the address value. This class is generated automatically by the Swagger code generator program and should not be edited manually.\n\nThe `AddressHolder` class has a single field, `address`, which is a string that holds the encoded ErgoAddress. The `address` field is annotated with `@SerializedName` and `@Schema`, which provide metadata about the field. The `@SerializedName` annotation specifies the name of the field in the serialized JSON representation of the object. The `@Schema` annotation provides a description of the field and specifies that it is required.\n\nThe `AddressHolder` class has a constructor that takes no arguments and a getter and setter method for the `address` field. The `toString()` method is overridden to provide a string representation of the object.\n\nThis class can be used in the Ergo Node API to represent an encoded ErgoAddress. For example, it can be used as a parameter or return type in API methods that require or return an encoded ErgoAddress. Here is an example of how this class can be used:\n\n```\nAddressHolder addressHolder = new AddressHolder();\naddressHolder.setAddress(\"9f7c5f3d7f7d7f7d7f7d7f7d7f7d7f7d7f7d7f7d7f7d7f7d7f7d7f7d7f7d7f7\");\nString address = addressHolder.getAddress();\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a Java class called `AddressHolder` that holds an encoded ErgoAddress.\n\n2. What dependencies does this code have?\n- This code depends on the `com.google.gson` and `io.swagger.v3.oas.annotations` libraries.\n\n3. Can the `address` field be null?\n- No, the `address` field is marked as required in the schema annotation and does not have a default value, so it must be set to a non-null value."
