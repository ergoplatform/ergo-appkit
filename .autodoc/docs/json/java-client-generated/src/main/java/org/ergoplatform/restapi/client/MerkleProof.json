  "summary": "The `MerkleProof` class is part of the Ergo Node API and is used to represent a Merkle proof for a leaf, which is an array of bytes (e.g. a transaction identifier). This class is auto-generated by the Swagger code generator program and should not be edited manually.\n\nThe `MerkleProof` class has two properties: `leaf` and `levels`. The `leaf` property is a base16-encoded Merkle tree leaf bytes. The `levels` property is a list of lists that represents the Merkle proof levels. Each level is a list of nodes that are hashed together to produce the parent node of the next level. The last level contains only the root node.\n\nThis class provides methods to set and get the `leaf` and `levels` properties. The `leaf` property can be set using the `leaf` method, and the `levels` property can be set using the `levels` method. The `addLevelsItem` method can be used to add a new level to the `levels` property.\n\nThis class also provides methods to check for equality and calculate the hash code of an object. The `toString` method returns a string representation of the `MerkleProof` object.\n\nThis class can be used in the larger project to represent Merkle proofs for leaves in the Ergo blockchain. For example, it can be used to verify that a transaction is included in a block by checking its Merkle proof against the Merkle tree root of the block. Here is an example of how this class can be used:\n\n```\nMerkleProof proof = new MerkleProof();\nproof.leaf(\"cd665e49c834b0c25574fcb19a158d836f3f2aad8e91ac195f972534c25449b3\");\nproof.addLevelsItem(Arrays.asList(\"018b7ae20a4acd23e3f1bf38671ce97103ad96d8f1c780b5e5e865e4873ae16337\", 0));\n```\n\nThis creates a new `MerkleProof` object with a leaf of `cd665e49c834b0c25574fcb19a158d836f3f2aad8e91ac195f972534c25449b3` and a single level with a node of `018b7ae20a4acd23e3f1bf38671ce97103ad96d8f1c780b5e5e865e4873ae16337` and an index of `0`.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a Java class called `MerkleProof` which represents a Merkle proof for a leaf, and contains a base16-encoded Merkle tree leaf bytes and a list of levels.\n\n2. What dependencies does this code have?\n- This code depends on the `com.google.gson` and `io.swagger.v3.oas.annotations` libraries.\n\n3. Can this code be modified manually?\n- No, this code should not be modified manually as it is auto-generated by the Swagger code generator program."
