  "summary": "The `AssetInstanceInfo` class is a model class that represents information about a specific asset instance. It contains six fields: `tokenId`, `index`, `amount`, `name`, `decimals`, and `type`. \n\nThe `tokenId` field is a string that represents the unique identifier of the token. The `index` field is an integer that represents the index of the asset in an output. The `amount` field is a long integer that represents the amount of tokens. The `name` field is a string that represents the name of the token. The `decimals` field is an integer that represents the number of decimal places. The `type` field is a string that represents the type of the token (token standard).\n\nThis class is used to represent asset instances in the Ergo Explorer API. It can be used to retrieve information about specific asset instances, such as their token ID, amount, and name. \n\nHere is an example of how this class might be used in the larger project:\n\n```java\nAssetInstanceInfo assetInstance = new AssetInstanceInfo()\n    .tokenId(\"abc123\")\n    .index(0)\n    .amount(1000L)\n    .name(\"My Token\")\n    .decimals(2)\n    .type(\"ERC20\");\n\nSystem.out.println(assetInstance.getTokenId()); // Output: abc123\nSystem.out.println(assetInstance.getAmount()); // Output: 1000\nSystem.out.println(assetInstance.getName()); // Output: My Token\n``` \n\nIn this example, a new `AssetInstanceInfo` object is created and its fields are set using the builder pattern. The `tokenId`, `index`, `amount`, `name`, `decimals`, and `type` fields are set to \"abc123\", 0, 1000L, \"My Token\", 2, and \"ERC20\", respectively. The `getTokenId()`, `getAmount()`, and `getName()` methods are then called on the `assetInstance` object to retrieve the values of those fields. The output of these calls is \"abc123\", 1000, and \"My Token\", respectively.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a Java class called `AssetInstanceInfo` that represents information about a token asset.\n\n2. What are the required fields for an `AssetInstanceInfo` object?\n- An `AssetInstanceInfo` object requires a `tokenId` and an `index` field.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `type` field in an `AssetInstanceInfo` object?\n- The `type` field represents the type of token standard that the asset adheres to."
