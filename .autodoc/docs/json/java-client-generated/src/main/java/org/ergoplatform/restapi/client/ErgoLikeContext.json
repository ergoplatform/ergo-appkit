  "summary": "The `ErgoLikeContext` class is part of the `ergo-appkit` project and is used to represent the context of an Ergo transaction. It contains various fields that are used to evaluate the transaction script. \n\nThe `lastBlockUtxoRoot` field is an `AvlTreeData` object that represents the root of the UTXO set of the last block. The `headers` field is a list of `SigmaHeader` objects that represent the headers of the last few blocks in descending order. The `preHeader` field is a `PreHeader` object that represents the pre-header of the current block. The `dataBoxes` field is a list of `ErgoTransactionOutput` objects that correspond to the data inputs of the transaction. The `boxesToSpend` field is a list of `ErgoTransactionOutput` objects that correspond to the inputs of the transaction. The `spendingTransaction` field is an `ErgoLikeTransaction` object that represents the transaction being evaluated. The `selfIndex` field is an index of the box in `boxesToSpend` that contains the script being evaluated. The `extension` field is a prover-defined key-value pair that may be used inside a script. The `validationSettings` field is a string that represents the validation parameters passed to `Interpreter.verify` to detect soft-fork conditions. The `costLimit` field is a hard limit on the accumulated execution cost, and if exceeded, leads to a `CostLimitException` being thrown. The `initCost` field is the initial value of the execution cost already accumulated before `Interpreter.verify` is called.\n\nThis class is generated by the Swagger code generator program and should not be edited manually. It provides a convenient way to represent the context of an Ergo transaction and can be used in conjunction with other classes in the `ergo-appkit` project to build Ergo applications. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```java\nErgoLikeContext context = new ErgoLikeContext();\ncontext.lastBlockUtxoRoot(lastBlockUtxoRoot)\n       .headers(headers)\n       .preHeader(preHeader)\n       .dataBoxes(dataBoxes)\n       .boxesToSpend(boxesToSpend)\n       .spendingTransaction(spendingTransaction)\n       .selfIndex(selfIndex)\n       .extension(extension)\n       .validationSettings(validationSettings)\n       .costLimit(costLimit)\n       .initCost(initCost);\n```\n\nThis creates a new `ErgoLikeContext` object and sets its fields using the provided values. The resulting object can then be used to evaluate an Ergo transaction script.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `ErgoLikeContext` class?\n- The `ErgoLikeContext` class is an API model for Ergo Node that contains various properties related to a transaction context.\n\n2. What are the required properties of the `ErgoLikeContext` class?\n- The required properties of the `ErgoLikeContext` class are `lastBlockUtxoRoot`, `headers`, `preHeader`, `dataBoxes`, `boxesToSpend`, `spendingTransaction`, `selfIndex`, `extension`, `validationSettings`, `costLimit`, and `initCost`.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `validationSettings` property?\n- The `validationSettings` property is used to pass validation parameters to `Interpreter.verify` in order to detect soft-fork conditions."
