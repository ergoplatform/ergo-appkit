  "summary": "The `BlocksApi` interface is part of the `ergo-appkit` project and provides methods for interacting with the Ergo blockchain. This interface defines several HTTP methods that can be used to retrieve information about blocks, headers, transactions, and more.\n\nThe `getBlockHeaderById` method retrieves the header information for a given block ID. The `getBlockTransactionsById` method retrieves the transaction information for a given block ID. The `getChainSlice` method retrieves a list of block headers within a specified range of heights. The `getFullBlockAt` method retrieves the header IDs at a given height. The `getFullBlockById` method retrieves the full block information for a given block ID. The `getHeaderIds` method retrieves an array of header IDs. The `getLastHeaders` method retrieves the last headers objects. The `getModifierById` method retrieves the persistent modifier by its ID. The `getProofForTx` method retrieves the Merkle proof for a given transaction ID. The `sendMinedBlock` method sends a mined block to the Ergo network.\n\nEach method takes in parameters that are used to construct the appropriate HTTP request. For example, the `getBlockHeaderById` method takes in a `headerId` parameter that is used to construct the URL for the HTTP GET request. The response from each method is wrapped in a `Call` object, which can be used to execute the request asynchronously.\n\nHere is an example of how to use the `getBlockHeaderById` method:\n\n```java\nBlocksApi blocksApi = retrofit.create(BlocksApi.class);\nCall<BlockHeader> call = blocksApi.getBlockHeaderById(\"blockId\");\ncall.enqueue(new Callback<BlockHeader>() {\n    @Override\n    public void onResponse(Call<BlockHeader> call, Response<BlockHeader> response) {\n        if (response.isSuccessful()) {\n            BlockHeader blockHeader = response.body();\n            // Do something with the block header\n        } else {\n            ApiError error = ApiErrorUtils.parseError(response);\n            // Handle the error\n        }\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onFailure(Call<BlockHeader> call, Throwable t) {\n        // Handle the failure\n    }\n});\n```\n\nIn this example, we create an instance of the `BlocksApi` interface using Retrofit. We then call the `getBlockHeaderById` method with a block ID parameter and enqueue the request to execute it asynchronously. When the response is received, we check if it was successful and handle the response or error accordingly.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines an interface for making REST API calls related to blocks in the Ergo blockchain.\n\n2. What dependencies are required to use this code?\n- This code requires the Retrofit2 library and its dependencies.\n\n3. What API calls can be made using this interface?\n- This interface allows for making API calls to get block header and transaction information, headers in a specified range, header IDs, last headers, persistent modifiers, and Merkle proofs for transactions. It also allows for sending a mined block."
