  "summary": "The code represents a Java class called `ScanId` which is a part of the Ergo Node API. The purpose of this class is to model a scan ID which is used to identify a specific scan in the Ergo blockchain. The class has a single field called `scanId` which is an integer representing the ID of the scan. \n\nThe class provides a getter and a setter method for the `scanId` field. The `getScanId()` method returns the value of the `scanId` field, while the `setScanId()` method sets the value of the `scanId` field. \n\nThe class also provides methods for equality checking, hashing, and string representation. The `equals()` method checks if two `ScanId` objects are equal by comparing their `scanId` fields. The `hashCode()` method returns a hash code value for the `ScanId` object based on its `scanId` field. The `toString()` method returns a string representation of the `ScanId` object, including its `scanId` field.\n\nThis class can be used in the larger Ergo Node API project to represent a scan ID in various API requests and responses. For example, a request to get information about a specific scan may include a `ScanId` object as a parameter, while a response from the API may include a `ScanId` object as a field in a JSON object. \n\nHere is an example of how this class can be used:\n\n```\nScanId scanId = new ScanId();\nscanId.setScanId(12345);\nint id = scanId.getScanId();\nSystem.out.println(\"Scan ID: \" + id);\n```\n\nThis code creates a new `ScanId` object, sets its `scanId` field to 12345, gets the value of the `scanId` field using the `getScanId()` method, and prints it to the console. The output will be \"Scan ID: 12345\".",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code is a Java class for a model called ScanId in the Ergo Node API.\n\n2. What is the significance of the @SerializedName and @Schema annotations?\n- The @SerializedName annotation is used to specify the name of the JSON property that corresponds to the Java field. The @Schema annotation is used to provide additional information about the field for documentation purposes.\n\n3. Why is the toString() method overridden in this class?\n- The toString() method is overridden to provide a string representation of the ScanId object for debugging and logging purposes."
