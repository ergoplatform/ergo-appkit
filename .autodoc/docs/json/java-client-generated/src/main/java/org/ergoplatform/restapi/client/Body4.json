  "summary": "The `Body4` class is a model class that represents a request body for a specific API endpoint in the Ergo Node API. The purpose of this class is to provide a Java representation of the JSON request body that is expected by the API endpoint. \n\nThe `Body4` class has a single field, `address`, which is a string representing a Pay2PubKey address. The `address` field is annotated with Swagger annotations that provide additional information about the field, such as an example value and a description. \n\nThe `Body4` class also includes standard Java methods such as getters, setters, and `equals`, `hashCode`, and `toString` methods. These methods are used to manipulate and compare instances of the `Body4` class. \n\nThis class is generated automatically by the Swagger code generator program and should not be edited manually. It is used in conjunction with other classes and methods in the `org.ergoplatform.restapi.client` package to interact with the Ergo Node API. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```java\nBody4 body = new Body4();\nbody.setAddress(\"3WzCFq7mkykKqi4Ykdk8BK814tkh6EsPmA42pQZxU2NRwSDgd6yB\");\nString address = body.getAddress(); // returns \"3WzCFq7mkykKqi4Ykdk8BK814tkh6EsPmA42pQZxU2NRwSDgd6yB\"\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code is a model class for the Ergo Node API, specifically for the Body4 object.\n\n2. What is the expected input for the `address` field?\n- The `address` field is expected to be a Pay2PubKey address, as indicated in the `@Schema` annotation.\n\n3. Can the `address` field be null or empty?\n- No, the `address` field is marked as required in the `@Schema` annotation, so it cannot be null or empty."
