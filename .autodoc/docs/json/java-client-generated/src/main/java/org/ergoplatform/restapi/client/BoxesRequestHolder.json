  "summary": "The `BoxesRequestHolder` class is part of the Ergo Node API and is used to hold requests for wallet boxes. It contains two fields: `targetAssets` and `targetBalance`. \n\nThe `targetAssets` field is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a specific asset and contains two elements: the asset ID and the amount. This field is used to specify which assets the user wants to include in their wallet boxes. \n\nThe `targetBalance` field is a Long that represents the desired total balance of the wallet boxes. This field is used to specify the total amount of Ergs (the native currency of the Ergo blockchain) that the user wants to include in their wallet boxes. \n\nThe class provides methods to set and get the values of these fields, as well as to add items to the `targetAssets` list. It also includes methods to override the `equals`, `hashCode`, and `toString` methods for object comparison and printing.\n\nThis class can be used in the larger project to create requests for wallet boxes that meet specific criteria. For example, a user may want to create wallet boxes that contain a certain amount of Ergs and a specific set of assets. They can use this class to create a request object that specifies these criteria and then send the request to the Ergo Node API to retrieve the desired wallet boxes. \n\nHere is an example of how this class can be used:\n\n```\nBoxesRequestHolder request = new BoxesRequestHolder();\nrequest.addTargetAssetsItem(Arrays.asList(\"asset1\", 100));\nrequest.addTargetAssetsItem(Arrays.asList(\"asset2\", 50));\nrequest.targetBalance(500);\n\n// Send request to Ergo Node API and retrieve wallet boxes that meet the specified criteria\nList<WalletBox> boxes = ergoNodeApi.getWalletBoxes(request);\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a Java class called `BoxesRequestHolder` that holds a request for wallet boxes.\n\n2. What are the required parameters for a `BoxesRequestHolder` object?\n- A `BoxesRequestHolder` object requires a `targetAssets` list and a `targetBalance` long value.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `targetAssets` list?\n- The `targetAssets` list holds a list of target assets for the wallet boxes."
