  "summary": "The code defines a Java class called `SpendingProof` which represents a spending proof for a transaction input. The class has two instance variables: `proofBytes` and `extension`. `proofBytes` is a string that represents the spending proof in bytes. `extension` is a map of key-value pairs that represent variables to be put into context. \n\nThe class has getter and setter methods for both instance variables. The `getProofBytes()` method returns the `proofBytes` instance variable, while the `getExtension()` method returns the `extension` instance variable. The `setProofBytes()` and `setExtension()` methods set the values of the `proofBytes` and `extension` instance variables respectively. \n\nThe class also has an `equals()` method that compares two `SpendingProof` objects for equality based on their `proofBytes` and `extension` instance variables. The `hashCode()` method returns a hash code for the `SpendingProof` object based on its `proofBytes` and `extension` instance variables. The `toString()` method returns a string representation of the `SpendingProof` object.\n\nThis class is part of the Ergo Node API and is used to represent spending proofs for transaction inputs. It can be used in conjunction with other classes in the Ergo Node API to build and manipulate transactions. For example, the `SpendingProof` class can be used to create a spending proof for a transaction input, which can then be added to a transaction using other classes in the Ergo Node API. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nSpendingProof spendingProof = new SpendingProof();\nspendingProof.setProofBytes(\"proofBytes\");\nMap<String, String> extension = new HashMap<>();\nextension.put(\"key1\", \"value1\");\nextension.put(\"key2\", \"value2\");\nspendingProof.setExtension(extension);\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a SpendingProof class for transaction input in the Ergo Node API.\n\n2. What is the format of the spending proof bytes?\n- The spending proof bytes are represented as a string.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the extension field?\n- The extension field is a map of variables to be put into context."
