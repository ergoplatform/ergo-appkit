      "summary": "The `RetrofitUtil` class in the `ergo-appkit` project provides access to a package-private method called `loadServiceMethod` in the `Retrofit` class. This method is used to bypass the usual proxy generation that doesn't work under Graal native-image. \n\nThe purpose of this class is to allow the invocation of service methods in Retrofit, which is a type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java. The `invokeServiceMethod` method takes in a `Retrofit` instance, a `Method` object representing the service method to be invoked, and an array of arguments to be passed to the method. It then calls the `loadServiceMethod` method on the `Retrofit` instance to obtain a `ServiceMethod` object, which is used to create a `Call` object that can be used to make the HTTP request. \n\nThis class is likely used in the larger project to facilitate communication between the ErgoNodeFacade in the `lib-impl` module and the Ergo blockchain network. The `invokeServiceMethod` method can be used to make HTTP requests to the Ergo blockchain network using Retrofit, which provides a convenient and type-safe way to interact with the network. \n\nHere is an example of how this class might be used in the larger project:\n\n```java\n// create a Retrofit instance\nRetrofit retrofit = new Retrofit.Builder()\n    .baseUrl(\"https://api.ergoplatform.com\")\n    .build();\n\n// get a reference to the ErgoNodeFacade service interface\nErgoNodeFacade ergoNodeFacade = retrofit.create(ErgoNodeFacade.class);\n\n// invoke a service method using RetrofitUtil\nCall<BlockHeader> call = RetrofitUtil.invokeServiceMethod(retrofit, \n    ErgoNodeFacade.class.getMethod(\"getBlockHeaderById\", String.class), \n    new Object[] { \"12345\" });\n\n// execute the HTTP request and get the response\nResponse<BlockHeader> response = call.execute();\nBlockHeader blockHeader = response.body();\n```\n\nIn this example, we create a `Retrofit` instance with a base URL of `https://api.ergoplatform.com`. We then use the `create` method to obtain a reference to the `ErgoNodeFacade` service interface, which defines methods for interacting with the Ergo blockchain network. We then use `RetrofitUtil.invokeServiceMethod` to invoke the `getBlockHeaderById` method on the `ErgoNodeFacade` interface, passing in the ID of the block header we want to retrieve. Finally, we execute the HTTP request and get the response, which contains the block header.",
      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this class and why is it needed? \n   Answer: This class provides access to a package-private method in Retrofit that is required to bypass usual proxy generation which doesn't work under Graal native-image.\n\n2. What is the significance of the \"@see\" tag in the class documentation? \n   Answer: The \"@see\" tag provides a reference to the ErgoNodeFacade in lib-impl, which is related to the purpose of this class.\n\n3. What does the \"invokeServiceMethod\" method do and what are its parameters? \n   Answer: The \"invokeServiceMethod\" method takes in a Retrofit instance, a Method object, and an array of arguments. It invokes the package-private loadServiceMethod method on the Retrofit instance using the Method object, and returns a Call object with the specified type parameter T."
