It provides methods for creating instances of the `ErgoClient` interface that are connected to a given node of the Ergo network, with or without an explorer connection.\n\nThe `RestApiErgoClient` constructor takes in the following parameters:\n- `nodeUrl`: the http url to the Ergo node REST API endpoint\n- `networkType`: the type of network (mainnet, testnet) the Ergo node is part of\n- `apiKey`: the api key to authenticate the client\n- `explorerUrl`: an optional http url to the Ergo Explorer REST API endpoint. If null or empty, the client works in the `node only` mode.\n- `httpClientBuilder`: an optional builder used to construct http client instances. If null, a new `OkHttpClient` with default parameters is used.\n\nThe `execute` method takes in a `Function` that operates on a `BlockchainContext` and returns a result of type `T`. It creates a `BlockchainContext` using a `BlockchainContextBuilderImpl` instance that takes in the `NodeAndExplorerDataSourceImpl` instance created by the constructor and the `networkType`. It then applies the given `Function` to the `BlockchainContext` and returns the result.\n\nThe `RestApiErgoClient` class also provides several static factory methods for creating instances of the `ErgoClient` interface:\n- `createWithoutExplorer`: creates a new instance of `ErgoClient` in the `node-only` mode, i.e. connected to a given node of the given network type and not connected to explorer.\n- `create`: creates a new instance of `ErgoClient` connected to a given node of the given network type.\n- `createWithHttpClientBuilder`: creates a new instance of `ErgoClient` connected to a given node of the given network type, with an optional `httpClientBuilder`.\n- `create`: creates a new instance of `ErgoClient` using node configuration parameters and an optional explorerUrl.\n- `createWithHttpClientBuilder`: creates a new instance of `ErgoClient` using node configuration parameters, an optional explorerUrl, and an optional `httpClientBuilder`.\n\nThe `RestApiErgoClient` class also provides a `getDataSource` method that returns the `NodeAndExplorerDataSourceImpl` instance created by the constructor.\n\nOverall, the `RestApiErgoClient` class provides a convenient way to create instances of the `ErgoClient` interface that are connected to a given node of the Ergo network, with or without an explorer connection. It abstracts away the details of creating and configuring the necessary API clients and provides a simple interface for executing operations on the Ergo blockchain.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code provides an implementation of the ErgoClient interface that uses the REST API of an Ergo node for communication.\n\n2. What are the parameters required to create a new instance of RestApiErgoClient?\n- To create a new instance of RestApiErgoClient, you need to provide the http url to the Ergo node REST API endpoint, the type of network the Ergo node is part of, an api key to authenticate the client, and an optional http url to the Ergo Explorer REST API endpoint.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the execute method in RestApiErgoClient?\n- The execute method in RestApiErgoClient takes a function that operates on a BlockchainContext and returns a result of type T. It creates a new BlockchainContext using the NodeAndExplorerDataSourceImpl and the network type, and applies the function to this context to obtain the result.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/appkit/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/appkit/RestApiErgoClient.md"}}],["1",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-appkit/appkit/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/appkit/config/ApiConfig.java)\n\nThe `ApiConfig` class in the `org.ergoplatform.appkit.config` package is responsible for storing the connection parameters for the Ergo node API. It has two private instance variables, `apiUrl` and `apiKey`, which are accessed through public getter methods.\n\nThe `getApiUrl()` method returns the URL of the Ergo node API endpoint. This URL is used to connect to the Ergo node and send requests to it. An example usage of this method would be to retrieve the current block height of the Ergo blockchain:\n\n```java\nApiConfig apiConfig = new ApiConfig();\napiConfig.setApiUrl(\"http://localhost:9052\");\nErgoClient ergoClient = RestApiErgoClient.create(apiConfig);\nint currentHeight = ergoClient.execute(ctx -> ctx.getHeaders().getHeight());\n```\n\nIn this example, an instance of `ApiConfig` is created and its `apiUrl` variable is set to the URL of the Ergo node API endpoint. An `ErgoClient` is then created using the `RestApiErgoClient.create()` method, which takes an instance of `ApiConfig` as an argument. Finally, the `execute()` method is called on the `ErgoClient` instance to retrieve the current block height of the Ergo blockchain.\n\nThe `getApiKey()` method returns the API key used for authentication with the Ergo node API. This key is a secret key whose hash was used in the Ergo node configuration. An example usage of this method would be to authenticate with the Ergo node API:\n\n```java\nApiConfig apiConfig = new ApiConfig();\napiConfig.setApiUrl(\"http://localhost:9052\");\napiConfig.setApiKey(\"mySecretApiKey\");\nErgoClient ergoClient = RestApiErgoClient.create(apiConfig);\nergoClient.execute(ctx -> ctx.getBoxesUnspent());\n```\n\nIn this example, an instance of `ApiConfig` is created and its `apiUrl` and `apiKey` variables are set to the URL of the Ergo node API endpoint and the secret API key, respectively.

The `ErgoClient` is a Java library that provides a high-level API for interacting with the Ergo blockchain. \n\nThe `ErgoNodeConfig` class has three private fields: `nodeApi`, `wallet`, and `networkType`. The `nodeApi` field is an instance of the `ApiConfig` class, which defines the connection parameters for the Ergo node's API. The `wallet` field is an instance of the `WalletConfig` class, which defines the parameters for working with the wallet. The `networkType` field is an instance of the `NetworkType` enum, which specifies the expected network type (Mainnet or Testnet).\n\nThe class has three public methods: `getNodeApi()`, `getWallet()`, and `getNetworkType()`. These methods return the values of the corresponding private fields. \n\nThis class can be used to configure an instance of the `ErgoClient` class. For example, to create an instance of the `ErgoClient` that connects to the Testnet Ergo node with the specified API and wallet configurations, the following code can be used:\n\n```\nApiConfig apiConfig = new ApiConfig(\"http://localhost:9053\");\nWalletConfig walletConfig = new WalletConfig(\"testnet\", \"password\");\nErgoNodeConfig nodeConfig = new ErgoNodeConfig(apiConfig, walletConfig, NetworkType.TESTNET);\nErgoClient client = ErgoClient.create(nodeConfig);\n```\n\nIn this example, the `ApiConfig` and `WalletConfig` instances are created with the necessary parameters, and then an instance of the `ErgoNodeConfig` class is created with these instances and the `NetworkType.TESTNET` enum value. Finally, an instance of the `ErgoClient` class is created with the `ErgoNodeConfig` instance. \n\nOverall, the `ErgoNodeConfig` class is an important part of the `ergo-appkit` project that allows developers to configure an instance of the `ErgoClient` class with the necessary parameters to interact with the Ergo blockchain.\n## Questions: \n 1.

It contains two fields: `node` and `parameters`, which represent the configuration of the Ergo node and the tool parameters, respectively. \n\nThe `getNode()` method returns the `ErgoNodeConfig` object, which contains the configuration parameters of the Ergo node. \n\nThe `getParameters()` method returns a `ToolParameters` object, which is a HashMap of name-value pairs representing the tool parameters. \n\nThe class provides three methods for loading the configuration from a file: `load(Reader reader)`, `load(File file)`, and `load(String fileName)`. The `load(Reader reader)` method takes a `Reader` object as input and returns an `ErgoToolConfig` object created from the file content. The `load(File file)` method takes a `File` object as input and returns an `ErgoToolConfig` object created from the file content. The `load(String fileName)` method takes a `String` object as input, which is the name of the file relative to the current directory. It then resolves the file using `File#getAbsolutePath()` and returns an `ErgoToolConfig` object created from the file content. \n\nThis class can be used in the larger project to manage the configuration parameters of the ErgoTool utility. Developers can use the `load()` methods to load the configuration from a file and then access the configuration parameters using the `getNode()` and `getParameters()` methods. For example, the following code loads the configuration from a file named `config.json` and then gets the node configuration:\n\n```\nErgoToolConfig config = ErgoToolConfig.load(\"config.json\");\nErgoNodeConfig nodeConfig = config.getNode();\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

This class overrides the `equals`, `hashCode`, and `toString` methods of the `HashMap` class to provide custom implementations.\n\nThe `equals` method checks if the given object is equal to the current object by comparing their classes and calling the `equals` method of the superclass.\n\nThe `hashCode` method returns the hash code of the superclass.\n\nThe `toString` method returns a string representation of the object by calling the `toIndentedString` method and appending it to a string builder.\n\nThe `toIndentedString` method is a private helper method that converts the given object to a string with each line indented by 4 spaces (except the first line).\n\nThis class can be used to store tool parameters in a key-value format and to compare them with other instances of the `ToolParameters` class. For example, if we have two instances of `ToolParameters` called `params1` and `params2`, we can compare them using the `equals` method like this:\n\n```\nif (params1.equals(params2)) {\n    // do something\n}\n```\n\nWe can also print the contents of a `ToolParameters` object using the `toString` method like this:\n\n```\nToolParameters params = new ToolParameters();\nparams.put(\"param1\", \"value1\");\nparams.put(\"param2\", \"value2\");\nSystem.out.println(params.toString());\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nclass Parameters {\n    {param1=value1, param2=value2}\n}\n```\n\nOverall, the `ToolParameters` class provides a convenient way to store and compare tool parameters in a key-value format.\n## Questions: \n 1.

The purpose of this class is to store the mnemonic, password, and mnemonic password used for generating keys in the wallet. \n\nThe `getMnemonic()` method returns the mnemonic used for generating keys in the wallet. It is important that this value is the same as the one used by the wallet of the node specified in `ErgoNodeConfig#getNodeApi()`. This ensures that the keys generated by the wallet are compatible with the node's wallet.\n\nThe `getPassword()` method returns the password used by the Ergo node wallet to protect wallet data. An empty or null string value means that no password is set.\n\nThe `getMnemonicPassword()` method returns the password used to protect the mnemonic. By default, this value is the same as the `password` value returned by the `getPassword()` method. \n\nThis class can be used in the larger project to configure the wallet used by the Ergo node. For example, a developer could create an instance of the `WalletConfig` class and set the mnemonic, password, and mnemonic password values to match the values used by the node's wallet. This instance could then be passed to other classes or methods that require access to the wallet configuration. \n\nHere is an example of how the `WalletConfig` class could be used in the larger project:\n\n```\nErgoNodeConfig nodeConfig = new ErgoNodeConfig(...);\nWalletConfig walletConfig = new WalletConfig();\nwalletConfig.setMnemonic(\"example mnemonic\");\nwalletConfig.setPassword(\"example password\");\nwalletConfig.setMnemonicPassword(\"example mnemonic password\");\nnodeConfig.setWalletConfig(walletConfig);\n```\n\nIn this example, an instance of the `ErgoNodeConfig` class is created with some unspecified parameters.

They enable developers to easily interact with the Ergo blockchain and perform various operations, such as retrieving the current block height or sending transactions.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/appkit/src/main/java/summary.md"}}],["11",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-appkit/appkit/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/appkit/ColdErgoClient.scala)\n\nThe code above defines a class called `ColdErgoClient` that extends the `ErgoClient` class. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to interact with the Ergo blockchain in a cold environment, meaning that the private keys are stored offline and not connected to the internet. \n\nThe `ColdErgoClient` class takes two parameters: `networkType` and `params`. `networkType` specifies which Ergo network to connect to (mainnet or testnet), while `params` is an instance of `BlockchainParameters` that contains information about the blockchain, such as the node's address and port number. \n\nThe class has a convenience constructor that takes three parameters: `networkType`, `maxBlockCost`, and `blockVersion`. This constructor creates a new instance of `NodeInfoParameters` with the given `maxBlockCost` and `blockVersion` values, and passes it to the main constructor. \n\nThe `execute` method overrides the same method in the `ErgoClient` class. It takes a `Function` that operates on a `BlockchainContext` and returns a result of type `T`. It creates a new instance of `ColdBlockchainContext` with the given `networkType` and `params`, and applies the given `Function` to it.

It also provides a method to parse the network type from a string.\n\n## `parseOptions`\n\n`parseOptions` takes a sequence of strings as input, which represents the command line arguments. It returns a tuple of two values: a map of options and their values, and a sequence of parameters.\n\nThe method first creates an empty map to store the options and their values. It then creates a mutable buffer and copies the input sequence into it. This buffer is used to extract options and parameters.\n\nThe method then iterates over the buffer and checks if each argument starts with the `CmdOption.Prefix` string, which is `\"--\"`. If an argument starts with this prefix, it is considered an option. The method then looks up the option in the `CmdOption.options` list, which is a list of predefined options. If the option is found, the method checks if it is a flag or not. If it is a flag, the value is set to `\"true\"`. If it is not a flag, the method checks if there is a value for the option in the next argument. If there is no value, an error is thrown. If there is a value, it is added to the map of options, and the value is removed from the buffer.\n\nIf an argument does not start with the `CmdOption.Prefix` string, it is considered a parameter and is left in the buffer.\n\nThe method returns the map of options and their values, and the remaining parameters in the buffer.\n\n## `parseNetwork`\n\n`parseNetwork` takes a string as input, which represents the network type. It returns a `NetworkType` object, which is an enumeration that represents the network type.\n\nThe method checks if the input string is `\"testnet\"` or `\"mainnet\"`. If it is, it returns the corresponding `NetworkType` object. If it is not, an error is thrown.\n\n## Usage\n\n`CmdLineParser` can be used to parse command line arguments in a Scala application. For example, the following code shows how to use `parseOptions` to parse command line arguments and print the options and parameters:\n\n```scala\nobject MyApp {\n  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {\n    val (options, params) = CmdLineParser.parseOptions(args)\n    println(\"Options:\")\n    options.foreach { case (name, value) =>\n      println(s\"$name=$value\")\n    }\n    println(\"Parameters:\")\n    params.foreach { param =>\n      println(param)\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf the application is run with the following command line arguments:\n\n```\n--conf myconf.json --verbose param1 param2\n```\n\nThe output will be:\n\n```\nOptions:\nconf=myconf.json\nverbose=true\nParameters:\nparam1\nparam2\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of this code?\n    \n    This code defines a command line parser for extracting options and parameters from the command line arguments passed to the Ergo Appkit CLI.\n\n2. What is the format of the options that can be passed to this command line parser?\n    \n    The options that can be passed to this command line parser start with `--` and are parsed into name-value pairs. Any option with `CmdOption.isFlag == true` is parsed without a value.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `parseNetwork` method?\n    \n    The `parseNetwork` method takes a string argument representing the network type and returns the corresponding `NetworkType` enum value. If the input string is not a valid network type, it raises a `usageError`.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/appkit/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/appkit/cli/CmdLineParser.md"}}],["15",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-appkit/appkit/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/appkit/cli/Console.scala)\n\nThe `Console` class is an abstract interface for console interactions, such as print and read operations. It defines methods for printing a string to the output stream, reading a line from the input stream, and reading a password. The `Console` class is implemented by two concrete classes: `MainConsole` and `TestConsole`.\n\nThe `MainConsole` class is a wrapper around the system console and is intended to be used in the `Application.main` method. It provides implementations for the methods defined in the `Console` class using the `System.console()` method to access the system console.\n\nThe `TestConsole` class is a console implementation intended to be used in tests. It takes a `BufferedReader` and a `PrintStream` as input and provides implementations for the methods defined in the `Console` class using these input and output streams.\n\nThe `Console` object provides utility methods for reading a new password from the console. The `readNewPassword` method takes a number of attempts and a `Console` instance as input, along with a code block that requests the user to enter a new password twice. It then compares the two passwords and returns the password as a `SecretString` if they match. If they do not match, it prompts the user to try again up to the specified number of attempts. If the user fails to enter a valid password within the specified number of attempts, it throws a `UsageException`.\n\nThe `Console` object also provides a convenience method `readNewPassword` that takes two prompts as input and uses the `Console` instance from the `AppContext` to read the passwords.\n\nThe `ConsoleException` class is an exception thrown by the `Console` class when incorrect usage is detected.\n\nOverall, the `Console` class and its implementations provide a way to interact with the console in a standardized way, making it easier to write and test console-based applications. The `readNewPassword` method is a useful utility for securely reading passwords from the console.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `Console` abstract class?\n- The `Console` abstract class defines an interface for console interactions, including print and read operations.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `readNewPassword` method in the `Console` object?\n- The `readNewPassword` method in the `Console` object provides a secure way to double-enter a new password, allowing the user multiple attempts before failing with an exception.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `TestConsole` class?\n- The `TestConsole` class is a console implementation to be used in tests, providing methods for printing and reading input/output streams.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/appkit/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/appkit/cli/Console.md"}}],["16",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-appkit/appkit/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/appkit/cli/HelpCmd.scala)\n\nThe code provided is a part of the ergo-appkit project and is located in the ergotool package. The purpose of this code is to provide a Help command that can be used to print usage help for a given command name. The Help command is implemented as a case class called HelpCmd, which takes three parameters: toolConf, name, and askedCmd. The toolConf parameter is an instance of ErgoToolConfig, which is used to configure the ErgoTool application. The name parameter is the name of the Help command, which is \"help\". The askedCmd parameter is the name of the command for which usage help should be printed.\n\nThe HelpCmd case class implements the run method, which takes an instance of AppContext as a parameter. The AppContext class provides access to the ErgoTool application context, which includes the list of available commands. The HelpCmd case class uses the commandsMap property of the AppContext class to look up the command with the given name. If the command is found, the printUsage method of the command is called to print the usage help. If the command is not found, an error message is printed.\n\nThe HelpCmd object provides a descriptor and parser for the Help command. The descriptor is an instance of the CmdDescriptor class, which provides information about the command, such as its name, syntax, and description. The parser is implemented as the createCmd method, which takes an instance of AppContext as a parameter and returns an instance of the HelpCmd case class. The createCmd method uses the cmdParameters property of the AppContext class to get the name of the command for which usage help should be printed.\n\nOverall, this code provides a useful Help command that can be used to get usage help for any command in the ErgoTool application. For example, to get usage help for the \"send\" command, the user can run the following command:\n\n```\nergotool help send\n```\n\nThis will print the usage help for the \"send\" command.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a HelpCmd class and a HelpCmd object that provide usage help for a given command name in the ergo-appkit project.\n\n2. What dependencies are required for this code to work?\n- This code requires dependencies from the org.ergoplatform.appkit.cli and org.ergoplatform.appkit.commands packages.\n\n3. How is the usage help printed for a given command name?\n- The run method of the HelpCmd class checks if the given command name exists in the commandsMap of the AppContext object and prints its usage help if it exists. Otherwise, it throws a CmdException with an error message.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/appkit/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/appkit/cli/HelpCmd.md"}}],["17",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-appkit/appkit/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/appkit/cli/Options.scala)\n\nThe code defines a set of classes and objects that represent command-line interface (CLI) options for the Ergo blockchain platform. The `CmdOption` class represents a single option that can be passed to a command-line tool. Each option has a name, a type, a description, and a flag indicating whether it is a boolean option (i.e., it does not have an associated value). The `ConfigOption`, `DryRunOption`, `PrintJsonOption`, and `LimitListOption` objects are instances of `CmdOption` that represent specific options that can be passed to the Ergo CLI tool.\n\nThe `CmdOption` class has two methods: `cmdText` and `helpString`. The `cmdText` method returns the text of the command line with the name of the option, while the `helpString` method returns a string that is printed for this option in the usage help output.\n\nThe `ConfigOption` object represents an option that specifies the path to a configuration file. The file has JSON content corresponding to the `ErgoToolConfig` class. The `DryRunOption` object represents an option that forces the command to report what will be done by the operation without performing the actual operation. This is useful for commands that perform some real-world effects such as sending a transaction to the blockchain. The `PrintJsonOption` object represents an option that forces commands to print objects as formatted JSON instead of rows in a table. The `LimitListOption` object represents an option that specifies a number of items in the output list.\n\nThe `CmdOption` class and its subclasses are used in the Ergo CLI tool to provide a flexible and extensible way to specify options for commands. For example, the `SendCmd` command might use the `DryRunOption` to allow users to preview the effects of sending a transaction before actually sending it. The `CmdOption` class and its subclasses can be used in other projects that require a CLI tool with extensible options. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\n$ ergo-cli --conf ergo_tool.json --dry-run\n```\n\nThis command runs the Ergo CLI tool with the `ConfigOption` and `DryRunOption` options. The `--conf` option specifies the path to a configuration file, and the `--dry-run` option forces the command to report what will be done by the operation without performing the actual operation.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `CmdOption` class?\n- The `CmdOption` class represents a CLI option description that can be used in command line to specify parameters to be used by the command during its operation.\n\n2. What is the difference between a regular option and a flag option?\n- A regular option is given using the syntax `--optionName optionValue`, while a flag option is given using the syntax `--optionName` without an `optionValue` part. If a `CmdOption` instance has `isFlag` set to `true`, then such option doesn't have an `optionValue` part and the option is interpreted as Boolean value (`true` if it is present, `false` otherwise).\n\n3. What are some examples of options supported by the `ergo-appkit` application?\n- Some examples of options supported by the `ergo-appkit` application are `ConfigOption` (string option to specify path to a configuration file), `DryRunOption` (flag option to prevent the command to perform actual operation and instead forces it to report planned actions), `PrintJsonOption` (flag option to force commands to print objects as formatted json instead of rows in table), and `LimitListOption` (specifies a number of items in the output list).","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/appkit/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/appkit/cli/Options.md"}}],["18",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-appkit/appkit/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/appkit/cli/Utils.scala)\n\n# `Utils` Object in `ergo-appkit`\n\nThe `Utils` object in the `ergo-appkit` project is a collection of utility methods that can be used throughout the project. The purpose of this object is to provide a set of common functions that can be used by other parts of the project to simplify code and reduce duplication.\n\nThe `loggedStep` method is one of the utility methods provided by the `Utils` object. This method takes three parameters: a message to print to the console, a `Console` object to use for printing, and a block of code to execute. The method prints the message to the console, executes the block of code, and then prints the status of the step (either \"Ok\" or \"Error\") to the console.\n\nHere is an example of how the `loggedStep` method might be used in the larger project:\n\n```scala\nimport org.ergoplatform.appkit.cli.Utils\n\nval console = new Console // create a new Console object\nval result = Utils.loggedStep(\"Performing step 1\", console) {\n  // code to execute for step 1\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `loggedStep` method is used to execute a block of code and print a message to the console.

It contains an error message, the command that threw the exception, and an optional cause.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `Cmd` class and its methods?\n- The `Cmd` class is a base class for all commands that can be executed by ErgoTool. Its methods include returning the current tool configuration parameters, returning the name of the command, returning the URL of the Ergo blockchain node used to communicate with the network, and running the command using the given `AppContext`.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `RunWithErgoClient` trait?\n- The `RunWithErgoClient` trait can be used to implement commands that need to communicate with the Ergo blockchain. It provides a default implementation of the `run` method and declares a new method with an additional `ErgoClient` parameter, which is called from the default implementation.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `CmdParameter` case class and its fields?\n- The `CmdParameter` case class is a descriptor for a command parameter. Its fields include the parameter name, display name, type, description, default value, interactive input, and argument parser. It is used to specify the syntax for a command and to parse its parameters from the command line.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/appkit/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/appkit/commands/Commands.md"}}],["21",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-appkit/appkit/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/appkit/commands/package.scala)\n\nThe code above defines a package object called \"commands\" within the \"org.ergoplatform.appkit\" package. This package object contains a single method called \"usageError\". \n\nThe purpose of this method is to report usage errors to the ErgoTool. The ErgoTool is a command-line interface (CLI) tool that allows users to interact with the Ergo blockchain. The \"usageError\" method is designed to be called when the user has provided incorrect or invalid input to the ErgoTool. \n\nThe method takes two parameters: \"msg\" and \"cmdDescOpt\". \"msg\" is a string that contains the error message to be displayed to the user. \"cmdDescOpt\" is an optional parameter that contains a CmdDescriptor object. The CmdDescriptor object provides a description of the command that the user was attempting to execute when the error occurred. \n\nIf the \"usageError\" method is called, it will throw a UsageException. The UsageException is a custom exception that is defined elsewhere in the Ergo appkit project. This exception is designed to be caught by the ErgoTool, which will then display the error message to the user. \n\nHere is an example of how the \"usageError\" method might be used in the ErgoTool:\n\n```\nif (args.length < 2) {\n  commands.usageError(\"Not enough arguments provided.\", Some(cmdDescriptor))\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the ErgoTool is checking to see if the user has provided enough arguments to a particular command. If not, it calls the \"usageError\" method with an appropriate error message and a CmdDescriptor object that describes the command that the user was attempting to execute.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `commands` package object?\n   - The `commands` package object likely contains utility functions or constants related to the Ergo platform app kit.\n2. What does the `usageError` function do?\n   - The `usageError` function throws a `UsageException` with a given error message and optional command descriptor.\n3. What is the expected use case for the `usageError` function?\n   - The `usageError` function is likely intended to be used by the ErgoTool to report errors related to incorrect usage of the app kit.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/appkit/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/appkit/commands/package.md"}}],["22",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-appkit/.autodoc/docs/json/appkit/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/appkit/commands)\n\nThe `Commands.scala` file in the `org.ergoplatform.appkit.commands` package is responsible for defining the structure and functionality of commands that can be executed by the ErgoTool application. It provides a set of classes and traits that can be extended or implemented to create custom commands for interacting with the Ergo blockchain.\n\nThe `Cmd` abstract class serves as the base class for all commands in ErgoTool. It provides methods for accessing the tool's configuration parameters, the command name, the Ergo node URL, the API key for authentication, and the network type (MAINNET or TESTNET). The `run` method is responsible for executing the command using the provided `AppContext`.\n\nFor commands that need to communicate with the Ergo blockchain, the `RunWithErgoClient` trait can be used. This trait extends the `Cmd` abstract class and overrides the `run` method to create an `ErgoClient` instance, which is then passed to the `runWithClient` method.\n\nTo define command parameters, the `CmdParameter` case class is used. It contains information about the parameter, such as its name, type, description, default value, and whether it is entered interactively or parsed from the command line.\n\nThe `CmdDescriptor` abstract class serves as the base class for command descriptors, which are usually companion objects. It defines the command name, parameter syntax, and a human-readable description. The `createCmd` method is responsible for creating a new command instance based on the given `AppContext`, while the `parseArgs` method parses command line arguments into a sequence of parameter values.\n\nFor parsing command line strings, the `CmdArgParser` abstract class is provided. It defines a `parse` method that takes a raw string and converts it into a value of the parameter type.\n\nThe `CmdArgInput` abstract class is an input handler for `CmdParameter`. It defines an `input` method that is called to input the given parameter.\n\nIn case of incorrect usage or errors during command execution, the `UsageException`, `ErgoToolException`, and `CmdException` case classes are provided. These exceptions contain error messages, optional command descriptors, and optional causes to help developers identify and handle issues.\n\nHere's an example of how to create a custom command using the provided classes and traits:\n\n```scala\nclass MyCommand extends Cmd with RunWithErgoClient {\n  override def name: String = \"my-command\"\n  override def ergoClient: ErgoClient = ...\n  // Implement the runWithClient method\n  override def runWithClient(ergoClient: ErgoClient, appCtx: AppContext): Unit = {\n    // Your command logic here\n  }\n}\n\nobject MyCommand extends CmdDescriptor {\n  override val name: String = \"my-command\"\n  override val description: String = \"A custom command for ErgoTool\"\n  override val syntax: String = \"my-command <param1> <param2>\"\n\n  override def createCmd(appCtx: AppContext): Cmd = new MyCommand\n  override def parseArgs(args: Seq[String]): Seq[CmdParameter] = ...\n}\n```\n\nIn summary, the `Commands.scala` file provides a framework for creating and executing commands in the ErgoTool application.

The script performs several tasks to achieve this goal, as detailed below.\n\nFirst, the script creates a directory called `.gnupg` in the user's home directory and sets its permissions to `700`. This ensures that only the owner of the directory can access its contents. Next, it creates a `gpg.conf` file in the `.gnupg` directory and adds the line `use-agent` to it. This line instructs GPG to use the GPG agent for passphrase handling.\n\nThe script then adds two more lines to the `gpg.conf` file: `pinentry-mode loopback` and `allow-loopback-pinentry`. These lines tell GPG to use a loopback pinentry program for passphrase handling, which allows GPG to read the passphrase from parameters instead of prompting the user for input.\n\nAfter configuring GPG, the script sets the permissions of all files in the `.gnupg` directory to `600`, ensuring that only the owner of the files can read or write to them. It then sends the `RELOADAGENT` command to the GPG agent to reload its configuration, ensuring that the changes made to the `gpg.conf` file take effect.\n\nFinally, the script decodes the GPG signing key from a base64-encoded string stored in an environment variable called `GPG_SIGNING_KEY`. The decoded key is stored in a file called `private.key` in the `.gnupg` directory. The script then imports the key into GPG using the `gpg` command.\n\nThis script is crucial for enabling secure communication between different components of the `ergo-appkit` project. For example, it may be used to sign and verify digital signatures on messages exchanged between different components, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of the messages.\n\nTo use this script, you would first need to export your GPG signing key as a base64-encoded string and set it as the value of the `GPG_SIGNING_KEY` environment variable. Then, you can run the script as follows:\n\n```bash\nexport GPG_SIGNING_KEY=base64-encoded-private-key\n./import_gpg.sh\n```\n\nThis will set up GPG2 for reading passphrase from parameters and import your GPG signing key, allowing you to securely communicate with other components of the `ergo-appkit` project.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/ci/summary.md"}}],["32",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-appkit/common/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/appkit/Address.java)\n\nThe `Address` class in the `ergo-appkit` project provides a set of methods for working with Ergo addresses.

ErgoAuth is a protocol for authentication and authorization on the Ergo blockchain. The `verifyResponse` method takes in four parameters: `sigmaProp`, `originalMessage`, `signedMessage`, and `signature`. \n\nThe `sigmaProp` parameter is a Sigma proposition that needs to be fulfilled for signing the message. The `originalMessage` parameter is the original message sent in the ErgoAuthRequest and needs to be contained in the `signedMessage`. The `signedMessage` parameter is the message signed by the client. Finally, the `signature` parameter is the signature for the `signedMessage`.\n\nThe `verifyResponse` method first checks if the `signedMessage` contains the `originalMessage`. If it does not, the method returns `false` indicating that the verification has failed. If the `signedMessage` contains the `originalMessage`, the method calls the `verifySignature` method from the `Signature` class to verify the signature. The `verifySignature` method takes in three parameters: `sigmaProp`, `signedMessage`, and `signature`. The `signedMessage` is converted to a byte array using the UTF-8 character set before being passed to the `verifySignature` method.\n\nThis utility class can be used in the larger ErgoAuth protocol implementation to verify the authenticity of a response from a client. For example, if a client sends a request to access a resource on the Ergo blockchain, the server can respond with an ErgoAuthResponse that includes a signed message. The client can then use the `verifyResponse` method to verify the authenticity of the response before accessing the requested resource.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nSigmaProp sigmaProp = new SigmaProp(\"pk:3f5d5d5d5d5d5d5d5d5d5d5d5d5d5d5d5d5d5d5d5d5d5d5d5d5d5d5d5d5d5d\");\nString originalMessage = \"Access granted to resource X\";\nString signedMessage = \"Access granted to resource X, signed by client\";\nbyte[] signature = // client's signature for signedMessage\n\nboolean isVerified = ErgoAuthUtils.verifyResponse(sigmaProp, originalMessage, signedMessage, signature);\nif (isVerified) {\n    // access resource X\n} else {\n    // authentication failed\n}\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

It is likely used to verify the authenticity of a message sent by a client.\n3. What is the format of the signature parameter in the `verifyResponse` method?\n- The signature parameter is a byte array, but it is not explained what format the signature should be in or how it is generated.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/common/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/appkit/ErgoAuthUtils.md"}}],["43",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-appkit/common/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/appkit/ErgoClientException.java)\n\nThe code above defines a custom exception class called `ErgoClientException`. This class extends the `RuntimeException` class, which means that it is an unchecked exception. This exception is typically thrown from the library code of the `ergo-appkit` project.\n\nThe purpose of this exception is to provide a way for the library code to handle and propagate errors that occur during runtime. When an error occurs, the root cause exception is caught and wrapped in an instance of `ErgoClientException`. This allows the library code to provide more meaningful error messages to the user, while still preserving the original exception information.\n\nHere is an example of how this exception might be used in the larger project:\n\n```java\ntry {\n    // some code that may throw an exception\n} catch (Exception e) {\n    throw new ErgoClientException(\"An error occurred while performing some operation\", e);\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `try` block contains some code that may throw an exception. If an exception is thrown, it is caught in the `catch` block. The `ErgoClientException` is then thrown, with the original exception passed as the cause. This allows the user to see a more descriptive error message, while still being able to access the original exception information if needed.\n\nOverall, the `ErgoClientException` class is an important part of the error handling mechanism in the `ergo-appkit` project.

An ErgoScript contract is a program that defines the rules for spending a UTXO (unspent transaction output) on the Ergo blockchain. The `ErgoContract` interface provides methods to access the information needed to compile an ErgoScript contract into an `ErgoTree` object, which can be used to create a transaction output on the Ergo blockchain.\n\nThe `ErgoContract` interface has five methods. The `getConstants()` method returns a `Constants` object that contains the named constants used in the contract. The `getErgoScript()` method returns the source code of the ErgoScript contract as a string. The `substConstant(String name, Object value)` method creates a new contract by substituting the constant with the given name with a new value. The `getErgoTree()` method returns the `ErgoTree` object that represents the compiled contract. Finally, the `toAddress()` method returns the base58 encoded address that represents the contract.\n\nThe `ErgoContract` interface is used in the larger `ergo-appkit` project to represent ErgoScript contracts. Developers can use this interface to create, modify, and compile ErgoScript contracts. For example, a developer could create a new contract by implementing the `ErgoContract` interface and providing the necessary information, such as the source code and named constants. The developer could then use the `getErgoTree()` method to compile the contract into an `ErgoTree` object, which can be used to create a transaction output on the Ergo blockchain.\n\nHere is an example of how the `ErgoContract` interface could be used to create a new contract:\n\n```\n// Define named constants\nConstants constants = new ConstantsBuilder()\n    .item(\"maxAge\", 100)\n    .item(\"minAge\", 50)\n    .build();\n\n// Define source code\nString ergoScript = \"HEIGHT < maxAge && HEIGHT > minAge\";\n\n// Create new contract\nErgoContract contract = new MyErgoContract(constants, ergoScript);\n\n// Compile contract into ErgoTree\nValues.ErgoTree ergoTree = contract.getErgoTree();\n\n// Get contract address\nAddress address = contract.toAddress();\n```\n\nIn this example, we define two named constants (`maxAge` and `minAge`) and a source code that checks if the current block height is between `maxAge` and `minAge`. We then create a new contract by implementing the `ErgoContract` interface and passing in the constants and source code. We can then compile the contract into an `ErgoTree` object and get the contract address.\n## Questions: \n 1.

The purpose of this class is to provide a way to compare and manipulate these identifiers in the context of the larger Ergo platform.\n\nThe class has a single constructor that takes a byte array as an argument and assigns it to a private field `_idBytes`. The `getBytes()` method returns the underlying byte array, while the `toString()` method returns a string representation of the identifier using Base16 encoding. The `create()` method is a static factory method that takes a Base16 string and returns a new `ErgoId` instance.\n\nThe `hashCode()` and `equals()` methods are overridden to support equality of `ErgoId` instances.

The `equals()` method first checks if the argument is null or the same instance, and then checks if it is an instance of `ErgoId` and has the same byte array as the current instance.\n\nOverall, the `ErgoId` class provides a simple and efficient way to represent and compare identifiers of Ergo objects in the larger Ergo platform.

Specifically, the `collByteToByteArray` method converts a `Coll<Byte>` type (defined in Scala) into a `byte[]` array (defined in Java). \n\nThe reason for this method is that directly calling Scala code from Java is not possible due to a compile error that expects a `Coll<Object>` type instead of the `Coll<Byte>` type defined in Scala. To work around this issue, the `byteColl` parameter is recast to a `Coll` type, which introduces a compiler warning. By defining this conversion method in a single place, it avoids having to repeat this workaround throughout the project.\n\nThis method can be used in the larger project to convert between `Coll<Byte>` and `byte[]` types as needed. For example, if a Scala method returns a `Coll<Byte>` type and a Java method requires a `byte[]` array, this method can be used to perform the conversion. \n\nHere is an example usage of the `collByteToByteArray` method:\n\n```\nimport org.ergoplatform.appkit.ScalaHelpers;\nimport special.collection.Coll;\n\n// create a Coll<Byte> object\nColl<Byte> byteColl = Colls.fromArray(new Byte[]{1, 2, 3});\n\n// convert Coll<Byte> to byte[] array\nbyte[] byteArray = ScalaHelpers.collByteToByteArray(byteColl);\n```\n\nIn this example, a `Coll<Byte>` object is created with three bytes. The `collByteToByteArray` method is then called with this object as the parameter, and the resulting `byte[]` array is stored in the `byteArray` variable. \n\nOverall, the `ScalaHelpers` class provides a useful set of conversion methods for working with Scala and Java data types in the `ergo-appkit` project.\n## Questions: \n 1.

The `SecretStorage` class provides a layer of abstraction over the `JsonSecretStorage` class, making it easier to use in the larger project.\n\nThe `SecretStorage` class provides two methods to unlock the storage: `unlock(SecretString encryptionPass)` and `unlock(String encryptionPass)`. Both methods take an encryption password as a parameter. The `SecretString` class is used to represent a string that should be kept secret. The `unlock(SecretString encryptionPass)` method calls the `unlock` method of the `JsonSecretStorage` object with the `SecretString` object converted to an `Interface4JSecretString` object. The `unlock(String encryptionPass)` method calls the `unlock(SecretString encryptionPass)` method with a `SecretString` object created from the string parameter.\n\nThe `SecretStorage` class provides two static methods to create a new `SecretStorage` object: `createFromMnemonicIn` and `loadFrom`.

The class also provides a method to extract the secret characters as an array.\n\nThe `SecretString` class provides a method to erase the secret characters stored in the instance so that they are no longer in memory. The `erase()` method fills the `_data` array with spaces (`' '`) to overwrite the secret data. This method is useful when the secret data is no longer needed and should not be leaked to the garbage collector.\n\nThe `SecretString` class provides methods to create new instances of `SecretString`. The `create(char[] data)` method creates a new instance wrapping the given characters. The `create(String s)` method creates a new instance by copying characters from the given `String`. The `empty()` method creates a new instance with an empty sequence of characters.\n\nThe `SecretString` class provides a method `toStringUnsecure()` that returns an unsecured `String` with secret characters. The secret characters are copied to the new `String` instance and cannot be erased in memory. So they leak to the garbage collector and may remain in memory until overwritten by new data. The usage of this method is discouraged, and the method is provided solely to interact with legacy code that keeps secret characters in `String`.\n\nThe `SecretString` class provides an implementation of the `hashCode()` and `equals()` methods. The `equals()` method compares the `_data` field of two `SecretString` instances and returns `true` if they are equal. The `hashCode()` method returns the hash code of the `_data` field.\n\nOverall, the `SecretString` class provides a secure way to store and manipulate secret data in memory. It is useful in situations where sensitive data needs to be protected from unauthorized access or leaks. The class can be used in the larger project to store and manipulate sensitive data such as passwords, private keys, and other secret information.\n## Questions: \n 1.

It returns a boolean value indicating whether the found tokens were needed to fill the tokens left.\n\nThe `useTokens` method takes an iterable of `ErgoToken` objects and marks the given tokens as selected, subtracting the amount values from the remaining amount of tokens needed to fulfill the initial tokens to spend. It also keeps track if a change box is needed in case too many tokens were selected.

It is designed to verify sigma-protocol propositions, specifically the `SigmaProp` type. \n\nThe `SigmaPropInterpreter` is an object that extends the `Interpreter` trait. It defines a type `CTX` that is an alias for `InterpreterContext`. The `Interpreter` trait is a part of the `sigmastate.interpreter` package and provides a framework for interpreting ErgoScript code. \n\nThe `SigmaPropInterpreter` is a simplified version of the `Interpreter` that does not require an `IRContext` and hence cannot perform script reduction. However, it can still verify sigma-protocol propositions. Sigma-protocol is a type of zero-knowledge proof that allows one party to prove to another party that they know a secret without revealing the secret itself. \n\nThis object can be used in the larger `ergo-appkit` project to verify sigma-protocol propositions. For example, if a user wants to verify a sigma-protocol proposition in their ErgoScript code, they can use the `SigmaPropInterpreter` object to do so. \n\nHere is an example of how the `SigmaPropInterpreter` object can be used:\n\n```scala\nimport org.ergoplatform.appkit.SigmaPropInterpreter\nimport sigmastate.Values.SigmaPropValue\n\nval sigmaProp: SigmaPropValue = ???\nval context: InterpreterContext = ???\n\nval result = SigmaPropInterpreter.verify(sigmaProp, context)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `SigmaPropInterpreter` object is used to verify a `SigmaPropValue` object. The `verify` method takes in the `SigmaPropValue` object and an `InterpreterContext` object as parameters and returns a boolean value indicating whether the proposition is valid or not. \n\nOverall, the `SigmaPropInterpreter` object provides a simple and lightweight way to verify sigma-protocol propositions in ErgoScript code without the need for an `IRContext`.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `SigmaPropInterpreter` object?\n   \n   The `SigmaPropInterpreter` object is a simple light-weight interpreter that can verify sigma-protocol propositions but cannot perform script reduction. \n\n2. What is the significance of the `CTX` type in the `SigmaPropInterpreter` object?\n   \n   The `CTX` type in the `SigmaPropInterpreter` object is an alias for `InterpreterContext`, which is the context type used by the interpreter.\n\n3. What is the relationship between the `SigmaPropInterpreter` object and the `Interpreter` trait?\n   \n   The `SigmaPropInterpreter` object extends the `Interpreter` trait, which means that it inherits all the methods and properties defined in the trait.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/common/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/appkit/SigmaPropInterpreter.md"}}],["63",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-appkit/common/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/appkit/Signature.java)\n\nThe `Signature` class in the `ergo-appkit` project provides a method for verifying a signature on an arbitrary message for a given public key. The purpose of this class is to provide a simple and convenient way to verify signatures in the context of the Ergo blockchain.\n\nThe `verifySignature` method takes three parameters: a `SigmaProp` object representing the sigma proposition the message should be signed with, a byte array representing the message to be verified, and another byte array representing the signature for the message. The method returns a boolean value indicating whether the signature is valid or not.\n\nThe `SigmaPropInterpreter.verifySignature` method is called internally by the `verifySignature` method to perform the actual signature verification. This method takes four parameters: a `SigmaBoolean` object representing the sigma proposition, a byte array representing the message, a byte array representing the signature, and a `Context` object representing the context in which the signature is being verified. In this case, the `Context` parameter is set to `null`, indicating that no additional context is required for the signature verification.\n\nThis class can be used in a variety of contexts within the Ergo blockchain, such as verifying signatures on transactions or validating signatures on smart contracts. Here is an example of how this class might be used to verify a signature on a transaction:\n\n```java\n// create a new Signature object\nSignature signature = new Signature();\n\n// create a new SigmaProp object representing the sigma proposition\nSigmaProp sigmaProp = new SigmaProp(\"pk:G2Q4jJ3JLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJ\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `Signature` class?\n    \n    The `Signature` class provides a static method `verifySignature` that verifies a signature on a given message for a given public key.\n\n2. Why is the constructor of the `Signature` class private?\n    \n    The constructor of the `Signature` class is made private to prevent instantiation of the class. This is because the class only provides a static method and does not need to be instantiated.\n\n3. What is the `SigmaProp` parameter in the `verifySignature` method?\n    \n    The `SigmaProp` parameter in the `verifySignature` method is the Sigma proposition that the message should be signed with. It is used to verify the signature on the message.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/common/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/appkit/Signature.md"}}],["64",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-appkit/common/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/appkit/impl/ErgoScriptContract.java)\n\nThe `ErgoScriptContract` class is a part of the `ergo-appkit` project and implements the `ErgoContract` interface. It represents a smart contract on the Ergo blockchain and provides methods to interact with it. \n\nThe class has three private fields: `_constants`, `_code`, and `_networkType`. `_constants` is an instance of the `Constants` class, which contains a map of constant values used in the contract. `_code` is a string that represents the ErgoScript code of the contract. `_networkType` is an instance of the `NetworkType` enum, which specifies the network type (Mainnet or Testnet) of the contract.\n\nThe class provides a public constructor that takes three parameters: `constants`, `code`, and `networkType`. It creates a new instance of the `ErgoScriptContract` class with the given parameters.\n\nThe class also provides several methods that implement the methods of the `ErgoContract` interface. The `getConstants()` method returns the `_constants` field. The `getErgoScript()` method returns the `_code` field.\n\nThe `substConstant(String name, Object value)` method creates a new instance of the `Constants` class with the same values as `_constants`, but with the value of the constant with the given `name` replaced with the given `value`. It then creates a new instance of the `ErgoScriptContract` class with the new `Constants` instance, the same `_code` value, and the same `_networkType` value.\n\nThe `getErgoTree()` method compiles the `_code` value into an `ErgoTree` instance using the `JavaHelpers.compile()` method. It takes the `_constants` instance, the `_code` value, and the network prefix of the `_networkType` instance as parameters. It then returns the resulting `ErgoTree` instance.\n\nThe `toAddress()` method returns an `Address` instance that represents the address of the contract on the Ergo blockchain. It does this by calling the `Address.fromErgoTree()` method with the `ErgoTree` instance returned by the `getErgoTree()` method and the `_networkType` instance as parameters.\n\nOverall, the `ErgoScriptContract` class provides a convenient way to create and interact with smart contracts on the Ergo blockchain. It allows developers to specify the constant values and ErgoScript code of the contract, and provides methods to compile the code, get the contract address, and replace constant values.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?\n- This code defines a class called `ErgoScriptContract` which implements the `ErgoContract` interface. It provides methods for creating and manipulating ErgoScript contracts, which are used in the Ergo blockchain to define transaction outputs and conditions for spending them.\n\n2. What are the input parameters for creating a new instance of `ErgoScriptContract`?\n- A new instance of `ErgoScriptContract` can be created by calling the static `create` method and passing in three parameters: a `Constants` object, a `String` containing the ErgoScript code, and a `NetworkType` object representing the network type (Mainnet, Testnet, or Regtest).\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `substConstant` method and how does it work?\n- The `substConstant` method takes in a `String` name and an `Object` value, and returns a new instance of `ErgoScriptContract` with the specified constant replaced by the new value. It works by cloning the original `Constants` object, replacing the specified constant, and creating a new `ErgoScriptContract` instance with the updated `Constants` object and the same ErgoScript code and network type.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/common/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/appkit/impl/ErgoScriptContract.md"}}],["65",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-appkit/common/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/appkit/impl/ErgoTreeContract.java)\n\nThe `ErgoTreeContract` class is a part of the `ergo-appkit` project and implements the `ErgoContract` interface. It represents a smart contract on the Ergo blockchain and provides methods to interact with it. \n\nThe class has two instance variables: `_ergoTree` of type `Values.ErgoTree` and `_networkType` of type `NetworkType`. The `_ergoTree` variable represents the ErgoTree of the smart contract, which is a serialized form of the contract script. The `_networkType` variable represents the network type on which the contract is deployed, either `MAINNET` or `TESTNET`.\n\nThe class provides four methods that are required by the `ErgoContract` interface. The `getConstants()` method returns the constants used in the contract, but it is not implemented in this class and throws a `RuntimeException`. The `getErgoScript()` method returns the serialized script of the contract, but it is also not implemented and throws a `RuntimeException`. The `substConstant(String name, Object value)` method substitutes a constant value in the contract script, but it is not implemented and throws a `RuntimeException`. The `getErgoTree()` method returns the `_ergoTree` instance variable, which represents the serialized script of the contract.\n\nThe `toAddress()` method returns the `Address` object of the contract. It uses the `_ergoTree` and `_networkType` instance variables to create an `Address` object using the `fromErgoTree()` method of the `Address` class.\n\nThis class can be used to represent a smart contract on the Ergo blockchain and to interact with it. It provides a way to get the serialized script of the contract and its constants, and to get the `Address` object of the contract. The `Address` object can be used to send Ergs or tokens to the contract, or to call its methods. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nValues.ErgoTree ergoTree = ... // get the serialized script of the contract\nNetworkType networkType = NetworkType.MAINNET; // set the network type\nErgoTreeContract contract = new ErgoTreeContract(ergoTree, networkType); // create a contract object\nAddress address = contract.toAddress(); // get the address of the contract\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

What is the purpose of the `substConstant` method?\n    \n    The `substConstant` method is intended to substitute a named constant in the contract with a new value. However, this method is not implemented and currently throws a `RuntimeException`.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/common/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/appkit/impl/ErgoTreeContract.md"}}],["66",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-appkit/.autodoc/docs/json/common/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/appkit/impl)\n\nThe `.autodoc/docs/json/common/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/appkit/impl` folder contains two Java classes, `ErgoScriptContract` and `ErgoTreeContract`, which are part of the `ergo-appkit` project. Both classes implement the `ErgoContract` interface and represent smart contracts on the Ergo blockchain, providing methods to interact with them.\n\n`ErgoScriptContract` allows developers to create and interact with smart contracts by specifying constant values and ErgoScript code. It provides methods to compile the code, get the contract address, and replace constant values. For example:\n\n```java\nConstants constants = ... // define constants\nString code = ... // define ErgoScript code\nNetworkType networkType = NetworkType.MAINNET; // set the network type\nErgoScriptContract contract = new ErgoScriptContract(constants, code, networkType); // create a contract object\nAddress address = contract.toAddress(); // get the address of the contract\n```\n\n`ErgoTreeContract` represents a smart contract on the Ergo blockchain using the serialized script (ErgoTree) of the contract. It provides a way to get the contract's `Address` object, which can be used to send Ergs or tokens to the contract or call its methods. However, it does not implement methods for getting constants or the ErgoScript code. Example usage:\n\n```java\nValues.ErgoTree ergoTree = ... // get the serialized script of the contract\nNetworkType networkType = NetworkType.MAINNET; // set the network type\nErgoTreeContract contract = new ErgoTreeContract(ergoTree, networkType); // create a contract object\nAddress address = contract.toAddress(); // get the address of the contract\n```\n\nBoth classes provide a convenient way to interact with smart contracts on the Ergo blockchain. Developers can choose the appropriate class based on their requirements, whether they need to work with ErgoScript code and constants (`ErgoScriptContract`) or directly with the serialized script (`ErgoTreeContract`). These classes can be used in conjunction with other parts of the `ergo-appkit` project to build and deploy smart contracts, send transactions, and interact with the Ergo blockchain.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/common/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/appkit/impl/summary.md"}}],["67",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-appkit/common/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/appkit/scalaapi/ErgoValueBuilder.scala)\n\nThe `ErgoValueBuilder` object is a helper builder that simplifies the construction of `ErgoValue` instances. `ErgoValue` is a class that represents a value in the Ergo blockchain, and it is used extensively throughout the Ergo appkit project. \n\nThe `buildFor` method takes two type parameters, `S` and `J`, which represent the Scala type and the corresponding Java type, respectively. The method also takes a value of type `S` and an isomorphism `iso` that maps `S` to `J`. The isomorphism is used to convert the Scala value to the corresponding Java value. \n\nThe method then constructs an `ErgoValue` instance of the Java type `J` that corresponds to the Scala type `S`. The `of` method of the `ErgoValue` class is used to create the instance, and it takes two arguments: the Java value and the Java class of the value. \n\nThis code is useful because it simplifies the creation of `ErgoValue` instances, which are used extensively throughout the Ergo appkit project. Instead of manually creating `ErgoValue` instances, developers can use the `ErgoValueBuilder` to construct them easily. \n\nHere is an example of how the `ErgoValueBuilder` can be used:\n\n```scala\nimport org.ergoplatform.appkit.scalaapi.ErgoValueBuilder\nimport org.ergoplatform.appkit.{ErgoTree, ErgoValue}\n\n// Define a Scala value\nval myValue: List[(Byte, List[Int])] = List((1.toByte, List(1, 2, 3)), (2.toByte, List(4, 5, 6)))\n\n// Define an isomorphism that maps the Scala value to the corresponding Java value\nimplicit val myIso = new Iso[List[(Byte, List[Int])], java.util.List[java.util.List[java.lang.Integer]]] {\n  override def toJava(s: List[(Byte, List[Int])]): java.util.List[java.util.List[java.lang.Integer]] = {\n    s.map { case (b, l) => l.map(Integer.valueOf).asJava }.asJava\n  }\n}\n\n// Use the ErgoValueBuilder to construct an ErgoValue instance\nval ergoValue: ErgoValue[java.util.List[java.util.List[java.lang.Integer]]] = ErgoValueBuilder.buildFor(myValue)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `myValue` variable is a Scala list of tuples, where each tuple contains a byte and a list of integers. The `myIso` variable is an isomorphism that maps the Scala list of tuples to a Java list of lists of integers. The `ErgoValueBuilder.buildFor` method is then used to construct an `ErgoValue` instance of the Java type `java.util.List[java.util.List[java.lang.Integer]]`.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a helper builder called `ErgoValueBuilder` that can be used to easily construct `ErgoValue` instances from Scala types supported by ErgoScript and ErgoTree.\n\n2. What is the input and output of the `buildFor` method?\n- The `buildFor` method takes a value of a Scala type supported by ErgoScript and an isomorphism that projects the given Scala type to the corresponding Java type. It returns an `ErgoValue` instance of the Java type that corresponds to the Scala type.\n\n3. How does the `buildFor` method convert the input value to an `ErgoValue` instance?\n- The `buildFor` method first uses the provided isomorphism to convert the input value to the corresponding Java type. It then creates an `ErgoValue` instance from the Java value and the Java type obtained from the isomorphism.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/common/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/appkit/scalaapi/ErgoValueBuilder.md"}}],["68",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-appkit/common/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/appkit/scalaapi/Extensions.scala)\n\nThe `Extensions` object in the `org.ergoplatform.appkit.scalaapi` package provides a set of extension methods for the `Coll` and `CollBuilder` classes. These methods are used to perform various operations on collections, such as partitioning, grouping, and reducing. \n\nThe `CollOps` extension class provides several methods for partitioning a collection based on a predicate, converting a collection to a map, summing the elements of a collection, and grouping elements of a collection by a discriminator function. The `mapReduce` method applies a mapping function to each element of the collection, groups the elements by key, and reduces each group using a reduction function. The `groupByProjecting` method is similar to `groupBy`, but it also applies a projection function to each element of the collection before grouping. \n\nThe `PairCollOps` extension class provides methods for mapping the first and second components of a collection of pairs, reducing a collection of pairs by key, summing a collection of pairs by key, and grouping a collection of pairs by key. \n\nThe `CollBuilderOps` extension class provides a method for performing an outer join operation between two collections. It also provides a method for constructing a collection of pairs from a map.\n\nThese extension methods can be used to simplify the code for working with collections in the Ergo Appkit project. For example, the `groupBy` method can be used to group UTXOs by their ErgoTree, which is useful for building transactions. The `mapReduce` method can be used to compute the total value of a collection of UTXOs. The `outerJoin` method can be used to join two collections of UTXOs based on their ErgoTree and perform some operation on the resulting pairs.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `Extensions` object?\n- The `Extensions` object provides extension methods for the `Coll` type, which is a collection type used in the project. \n\n2. What does the `sum` method do?\n- The `sum` method calculates the sum of the elements in a collection using the `Numeric` typeclass. If the collection is empty, it returns the zero value of the `Numeric` type.\n\n3. What is the difference between `groupBy` and `groupByProjecting`?\n- `groupBy` partitions a collection into a map of collections according to a discriminator function, where the keys of the map are the results of applying the discriminator function to the elements of the collection. `groupByProjecting` is similar, but it also applies a projection function to each element of the collection before grouping. The resulting map has keys that are the results of applying the discriminator function, and values that are collections of the projected values.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/common/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/appkit/scalaapi/Extensions.md"}}],["69",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-appkit/common/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/appkit/scalaapi/Iso.scala)\n\nThe `Iso` class and its related classes define an isomorphism between Scala and Java types. An isomorphism is a bi-directional mapping between two types that preserves their structure. The `Iso` class is abstract and has two type parameters, `S` and `J`, which represent the Scala and Java types, respectively. The class has four methods: `scalaType`, `javaType`, `toJava`, and `toScala`. The `scalaType` and `javaType` methods return the type descriptors for the corresponding types. The `toJava` method converts a value of type `S` to a value of type `J`, and the `toScala` method converts a value of type `J` to a value of type `S`.\n\nThe `Iso` class has several subclasses that implement specific isomorphisms. The `IdentityIso` class is a subclass that implements an isomorphism between a type and itself. The `PrimIso` class is a subclass that implements an isomorphism between a primitive Scala type and its corresponding Java wrapper type. The `PairIso` class is a subclass that implements an isomorphism between a Scala pair type and a Java pair type. The `CollIso` class is a subclass that implements an isomorphism between a Scala collection type and a Java collection type.\n\nThe `Iso` object contains several implicit isomorphisms between Scala and Java types. These isomorphisms are used to convert values between the two languages. For example, the `isoByte` isomorphism converts a Scala `Byte` value to a Java `Byte` value, and the `isoColl` isomorphism converts a Scala collection of type `Coll[S]` to a Java collection of type `Coll[J]`.\n\nThe `Iso` class and its related classes are used throughout the `ergo-appkit` project to convert values between Scala and Java types. This is particularly useful when working with the Ergo blockchain, which uses a Java-based scripting language called Sigma. The `Iso` class allows developers to work with Scala types in their code and then convert them to Java types when interacting with the Ergo blockchain.\n## Questions: \n 1.

It takes three projection functions as arguments: `l`, `r`, and `inner`. The `l` function is executed for each element of the `left` map, the `r` function is executed for each element of the `right` map, and the `inner` function is executed for matching items `(K, L)` and `(K, R)` with the same `K`. The function returns a map of `(K, O)` pairs, where each key comes from either the `left` or `right` map and values are produced by the projections. \n\nHere is an example of how to use the `outerJoin` function:\n\n```scala\nval left = Map(\"a\" -> 1, \"b\" -> 2)\nval right = Map(\"b\" -> 3, \"c\" -> 4)\n\nval result = Utils.outerJoin(left, right)(\n  (k, l) => l + 1, \n  (k, r) => r * 2, \n  (k, l, r) => l + r\n)\n\n// result: Map(\"a\" -> 2, \"b\" -> 5, \"c\" -> 8)\n```\n\nThe `mapReduce` function is a performance-optimized deterministic mapReduce primitive. It takes an array `arr` to be mapped to `(K, V)` pairs, a mapper function `m`, and a value reduction function `r`. The function returns a pair of arrays `(keys, values)`, where keys appear in order of their first production by `m` and for each `i => values(i)` corresponds to `keys(i)`. \n\nHere is an example of how to use the `mapReduce` function:\n\n```scala\nval arr = Array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n\nval (keys, values) = Utils.mapReduce(arr, \n  (a: Int) => (a % 2, a), \n  (a: (Int, Int)) => a._1 + a._2\n)\n\n// keys: Array(1, 0)\n// values: Array(9, 6)\n```\n\nThe `mapToArrays` function converts a `Map` to a tuple of arrays, where the first array contains all keys of the map and the second array contains all values of the map. \n\nHere is an example of how to use the `mapToArrays` function:\n\n```scala\nval m = Map(\"a\" -> 1, \"b\" -> 2, \"c\" -> 3)\n\nval (keys, values) = Utils.mapToArrays(m)\n\n// keys: Array(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\")\n// values: Array(1, 2, 3)\n```\n\nThe `IntegralFromExactIntegral` class can adapt an `ExactIntegral` instance to be used where `Integral` is required. It implements the `Integral` trait and provides implementations for all of its methods. \n\nHere is an example of how to use the `IntegralFromExactIntegral` class:\n\n```scala\nimport scalan.math.Rational\n\nval ei = new ExactIntegral[Rational] {\n  override def plus(x: Rational, y: Rational): Rational = x + y\n  override def minus(x: Rational, y: Rational): Rational = x - y\n  override def times(x: Rational, y: Rational): Rational = x * y\n  override def negate(x: Rational): Rational = -x\n  override def fromInt(x: Int): Rational = Rational(x)\n  override def toInt(x: Rational): Int = x.toInt\n  override def toLong(x: Rational): Long = x.toLong\n  override def toFloat(x: Rational): Float = x.toFloat\n  override def toDouble(x: Rational): Double = x.toDouble\n  override def compare(x: Rational, y: Rational): Int = x.compare(y)\n  override def divisionRemainder(x: Rational, y: Rational): Rational = x % y\n  override def quot(x: Rational, y: Rational): Rational = x / y\n}\n\nval integral = new Utils.IntegralFromExactIntegral(ei)\n\nval a = Rational(3, 4)\nval b = Rational(1, 2)\n\nval sum = integral.plus(a, b) // Rational(5, 4)\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What does the `outerJoin` function do and how is it used?\n- The `outerJoin` function performs an outer join operation between two maps, with optional projection functions for each map and a third projection function for matching items. It returns a map of (K, O) pairs. It can be used to combine data from two maps based on a common key.\n2. What is the purpose of the `mapReduce` function and how is it different from a regular `map` and `reduce` operation?\n- The `mapReduce` function is a performance-optimized deterministic mapReduce primitive that takes an array and applies a mapper function to produce (K, V) pairs, then reduces the values for each key using a value reduction function. It returns a pair of arrays (keys, values) where keys appear in order of their first production by the mapper function. It is different from a regular `map` and `reduce` operation because it guarantees the order of the keys and values in the output.\n3. What is the purpose of the `IntegralFromExactIntegral` class and how is it used?\n- The `IntegralFromExactIntegral` class can adapt an `ExactIntegral` instance to be used where `Integral` is required. It provides implementations for all `Integral` methods using the corresponding methods from `ExactIntegral`. It can be used to convert between different numeric types with different precision and rounding behavior.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/common/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/appkit/scalaapi/Utils.md"}}],["71",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-appkit/common/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/appkit/scalaapi/package.scala)\n\nThe code above defines a package object called `scalaapi` which contains implicit instances of `ErgoType` for various types. `ErgoType` is a type class that provides a way to serialize and deserialize types used in ErgoScript, the scripting language used in the Ergo blockchain. \n\nThe purpose of this code is to provide a convenient way for developers to use ErgoScript types in their Scala code. By defining these implicit instances, developers can pass values of these types to ErgoScript functions without having to manually serialize and deserialize them. \n\nFor example, if a developer wants to pass a `Long` value to an ErgoScript function, they can simply pass the value directly and the `scalaLongType` implicit instance will handle the serialization and deserialization. \n\n```scala\nval longValue: Long = 1234567890L\nval ergoScriptFunction: ErgoContext => Long => Boolean = ???\nval result: Boolean = ergoScriptFunction(ergoContext)(longValue)\n```\n\nThis code is part of the larger `ergo-appkit` project, which provides a set of tools and libraries for building applications on the Ergo blockchain. By providing these implicit instances, the `ergo-appkit` project makes it easier for developers to work with ErgoScript types in their Scala code, which can help to reduce the amount of boilerplate code needed and improve the overall developer experience.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines global instances of `ErgoType` for various Java and Scala types used in the Ergo platform.\n\n2.

It is used to define implicit instances of `ErgoType` for various types in this code.\n\n3. What is the significance of the `sigma` package and its types used in this code?\n- The `sigma` package contains types used in the ErgoScript language, which is used to write smart contracts on the Ergo platform. The `sigma` types used in this code represent various components of a transaction or block in the Ergo blockchain.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/common/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/appkit/scalaapi/package.md"}}],["72",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-appkit/.autodoc/docs/json/common/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/appkit/scalaapi)\n\nThe `.autodoc/docs/json/common/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/appkit/scalaapi` folder contains utility classes and objects that facilitate the interaction between Scala and Java types in the Ergo Appkit project. These utilities are particularly useful when working with the Ergo blockchain, which uses a Java-based scripting language called Sigma.\n\n`ErgoValueBuilder.scala` provides a helper builder for constructing `ErgoValue` instances, which represent values in the Ergo blockchain. The `buildFor` method simplifies the creation of `ErgoValue` instances by taking a Scala value, an isomorphism, and converting the value to its corresponding Java type. For example:\n\n```scala\nval ergoValue: ErgoValue[java.util.List[java.util.List[java.lang.Integer]]] = ErgoValueBuilder.buildFor(myValue)\n```\n\n`Extensions.scala` offers extension methods for the `Coll` and `CollBuilder` classes, simplifying operations like partitioning, grouping, and reducing. For instance, the `groupBy` method can be used to group UTXOs by their ErgoTree, which is useful for building transactions.\n\n`Iso.scala` defines an isomorphism between Scala and Java types, allowing developers to work with Scala types in their code and convert them to Java types when interacting with the Ergo blockchain. The `Iso` class has several subclasses that implement specific isomorphisms, such as `IdentityIso`, `PrimIso`, `PairIso`, and `CollIso`.\n\n`Utils.scala` provides utility functions that can be used across the Ergo Appkit project.

These formats include CSV, SSV, TSV, and PIPES. \n\nThe `CSVParams`, `SSVParams`, `TSVParams`, and `PIPESParams` classes are all subclasses of the `CollectionFormats` class. Each of these subclasses has a `toString()` method that formats the list of strings into the corresponding format. \n\nThe `CSVParams` class formats the list of strings into a comma-separated value format. The `SSVParams` class formats the list of strings into a space-separated value format. The `TSVParams` class formats the list of strings into a tab-separated value format. The `PIPESParams` class formats the list of strings into a pipe-separated value format. \n\nEach of these subclasses has three constructors: a default constructor, a constructor that takes a list of strings, and a constructor that takes a variable number of string arguments. The `getParams()` and `setParams()` methods are used to get and set the list of strings that will be formatted. \n\nThis code can be used in the larger project to format collections of strings into various formats for use in different parts of the application. For example, if the application needs to output data in a CSV format, the `CSVParams` class can be used to format the data. Similarly, if the application needs to output data in a different format, such as a space-separated value format, the `SSVParams` class can be used. \n\nHere is an example of how the `CSVParams` class can be used to format a list of strings:\n\n```\nList<String> params = Arrays.asList(\"param1\", \"param2\", \"param3\");\nCSVParams csvParams = new CSVParams(params);\nString formattedParams = csvParams.toString();\n```\n\nIn this example, a list of strings is created and passed to the `CSVParams` constructor. The `toString()` method is then called on the `csvParams` object to format the list of strings into a CSV format. The resulting string, `formattedParams`, can then be used in the application as needed.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `CollectionFormats` class?\n    \n    `CollectionFormats` is a class that contains several nested classes that define different formats for collections of strings.\n\n2. What are the differences between the `CSVParams`, `SSVParams`, `TSVParams`, and `PIPESParams` classes?\n    \n    Each of these classes extends the `CSVParams` class and overrides the `toString()` method to define a different delimiter for joining the list of strings. `SSVParams` uses a space delimiter, `TSVParams` uses a tab delimiter, and `PIPESParams` uses a pipe delimiter.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `StringUtil` class?\n    \n    The `StringUtil` class is not included in this code snippet, so a smart developer might wonder what it does and where it is defined. It is likely a utility class that provides string manipulation methods, such as `join()`, which is used in the `toString()` methods of the nested classes to join the list of strings with a delimiter.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/java-client-generated/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/explorer/client/CollectionFormats.md"}}],["81",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-appkit/java-client-generated/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/explorer/client/DefaultApi.java)\n\nThe `DefaultApi` interface in the `org.ergoplatform.explorer.client` package provides a set of methods for interacting with the Ergo blockchain explorer API. This interface is used to fetch various types of data from the Ergo blockchain, such as balances, transactions, blocks, and tokens.\n\nFor example, the `getApiV1AddressesP1BalanceConfirmed` method retrieves the confirmed balance of a given address with an optional minimum number of confirmations. Similarly, the `getApiV1AddressesP1Transactions` method fetches the transactions associated with a specific address, with optional parameters for pagination and concise output.\n\nThe interface also provides methods for fetching data related to blocks, such as `getApiV1Blocks` which retrieves a list of blocks with optional pagination and sorting parameters, and `getApiV1BlocksP1` which fetches the summary of a specific block.\n\nToken-related methods include `getApiV1Tokens` which retrieves a list of tokens with optional pagination, sorting, and filtering parameters, and `getApiV1TokensP1` which fetches the information of a specific token.\n\nAdditionally, there are methods for searching and filtering data, such as `postApiV1BoxesSearch` which allows searching for boxes based on a `BoxQuery` object, and `getApiV1TransactionsByinputsscripttemplatehashP1` which fetches transactions based on an input script template hash.\n\nOverall, the `DefaultApi` interface serves as a bridge between the Ergo blockchain explorer API and the ergo-appkit project, allowing developers to easily fetch and interact with data from the Ergo blockchain.\n## Questions: \n 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `DefaultApi` interface?\n   **Answer**: The `DefaultApi` interface defines the API endpoints and their corresponding methods for interacting with the Ergo Explorer API.

For example, if a client sends a request to the server to retrieve data that does not exist, the server may return a `BadRequest` object with a `status` of 404 (Not Found) and a `reason` of \"Data not found\". \n\nHere is an example of how this class may be used in a server method:\n\n```java\npublic Data getData(String id) {\n  Data data = dataRepository.findById(id);\n  if (data == null) {\n    BadRequest error = new BadRequest()\n        .status(404)\n        .reason(\"Data not found\");\n    throw new ApiException(error);\n  }\n  return data;\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `getData` method retrieves data from a repository based on an ID. If the data does not exist, the method throws an `ApiException` with a `BadRequest` object that represents the error response. The client can then handle this error response appropriately.\n## Questions: \n 1.

The `NotFound` class has two properties: `status` and `reason`, both of which are serialized using the Gson library. The `status` property is an integer that represents the HTTP status code of the response, while the `reason` property is a string that provides a human-readable explanation of why the requested resource was not found.\n\nThis class is used in the Ergo Explorer API to provide a standardized response format for requests that result in a 404 Not Found error. By using this class, the API can ensure that clients receive a consistent response format regardless of the specific resource that was not found.\n\nHere is an example of how this class might be used in the larger Ergo Explorer project:\n\n```java\nimport org.ergoplatform.explorer.client.api.NotFoundException;\nimport org.ergoplatform.explorer.client.api.ExplorerApi;\nimport org.ergoplatform.explorer.client.model.NotFound;\n\nExplorerApi api = new ExplorerApi();\ntry {\n    // Make a request to the API to retrieve a resource that does not exist\n    api.getResource(\"nonexistent-resource\");\n} catch (NotFoundException e) {\n    // Handle the 404 Not Found error by parsing the response body as a NotFound object\n    NotFound notFound = e.getResponseBody();\n    System.out.println(\"Resource not found: \" + notFound.getReason());\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `ExplorerApi` class is used to make a request to the Ergo Explorer API to retrieve a resource that does not exist. If the API returns a 404 Not Found error, the `NotFoundException` is caught and the response body is parsed as a `NotFound` object. The `reason` property of the `NotFound` object is then used to provide a user-friendly error message to the client.\n## Questions: \n 1.

It is used in the Ergo Node API to hold the address value. This class is generated automatically by the Swagger code generator program and should not be edited manually.\n\nThe `AddressHolder` class has a single field, `address`, which is a string that holds the encoded ErgoAddress. The `address` field is annotated with `@SerializedName` and `@Schema`, which provide metadata about the field.

The `isValid` field is a boolean that indicates whether the address is valid or not. The `error` field is a string that contains an error message if the address is invalid.\n\nThe purpose of this class is to provide a standardized way of checking the validity of Ergo addresses.

The purpose of this class is to represent a logical AND operation between multiple scanning predicates. \n\nThe class has a single field called `args`, which is a list of `ScanningPredicate` objects. This list represents the scanning predicates that are being ANDed together. The `args` field can be set using the `args` method, which takes a list of `ScanningPredicate` objects, or by calling the `addArgsItem` method, which adds a single `ScanningPredicate` object to the list.\n\nThe class also overrides several methods from the `Object` class, including `equals`, `hashCode`, and `toString`. These methods are used to compare `AndPredicate` objects, generate hash codes for `AndPredicate` objects, and generate string representations of `AndPredicate` objects, respectively.\n\nThis class is likely used in the larger project to represent complex scanning predicates that require multiple conditions to be met. For example, if a scanning operation needs to find all transactions that have both a certain output and a certain input, an `AndPredicate` object could be used to represent this condition. \n\nHere is an example of how an `AndPredicate` object could be created and used:\n\n```\n// Create two scanning predicates\nScanningPredicate predicate1 = new ScanningPredicate();\nScanningPredicate predicate2 = new ScanningPredicate();\n\n// Create an AndPredicate object and add the two scanning predicates to it\nAndPredicate andPredicate = new AndPredicate();\nandPredicate.addArgsItem(predicate1);\nandPredicate.addArgsItem(predicate2);\n\n// Use the AndPredicate object in a scanning operation\nList<Transaction> transactions = scanner.scan(andPredicate);\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

This interface defines several HTTP methods that can be used to retrieve information about blocks, headers, transactions, and more.\n\nThe `getBlockHeaderById` method retrieves the header information for a given block ID. The `getBlockTransactionsById` method retrieves the transaction information for a given block ID. The `getChainSlice` method retrieves a list of block headers within a specified range of heights. The `getFullBlockAt` method retrieves the header IDs at a given height. The `getFullBlockById` method retrieves the full block information for a given block ID. The `getHeaderIds` method retrieves an array of header IDs. The `getLastHeaders` method retrieves the last headers objects. The `getModifierById` method retrieves the persistent modifier by its ID. The `getProofForTx` method retrieves the Merkle proof for a given transaction ID. The `sendMinedBlock` method sends a mined block to the Ergo network.\n\nEach method takes in parameters that are used to construct the appropriate HTTP request. For example, the `getBlockHeaderById` method takes in a `headerId` parameter that is used to construct the URL for the HTTP GET request. The response from each method is wrapped in a `Call` object, which can be used to execute the request asynchronously.\n\nHere is an example of how to use the `getBlockHeaderById` method:\n\n```java\nBlocksApi blocksApi = retrofit.create(BlocksApi.class);\nCall<BlockHeader> call = blocksApi.getBlockHeaderById(\"blockId\");\ncall.enqueue(new Callback<BlockHeader>() {\n    @Override\n    public void onResponse(Call<BlockHeader> call, Response<BlockHeader> response) {\n        if (response.isSuccessful()) {\n            BlockHeader blockHeader = response.body();\n            // Do something with the block header\n        } else {\n            ApiError error = ApiErrorUtils.parseError(response);\n            // Handle the error\n        }\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onFailure(Call<BlockHeader> call, Throwable t) {\n        // Handle the failure\n    }\n});\n```\n\nIn this example, we create an instance of the `BlocksApi` interface using Retrofit. We then call the `getBlockHeaderById` method with a block ID parameter and enqueue the request to execute it asynchronously. When the response is received, we check if it was successful and handle the response or error accordingly.\n## Questions: \n 1.

The purpose of this code is to provide a convenient way to format collections of parameters for use in REST API requests.\n\nThe `CSVParams` class represents a collection of parameters separated by commas. It has three constructors: one that takes no arguments, one that takes a `List` of `String` parameters, and one that takes a variable number of `String` parameters. It also has a `toString()` method that joins the parameters into a comma-separated string.\n\nThe `SSVParams` class extends `CSVParams` and represents a collection of parameters separated by spaces. It has the same constructors as `CSVParams`, but overrides the `toString()` method to join the parameters into a space-separated string.\n\nThe `TSVParams` class extends `CSVParams` and represents a collection of parameters separated by tabs. It has the same constructors as `CSVParams`, but overrides the `toString()` method to join the parameters into a tab-separated string.\n\nThe `PIPESParams` class extends `CSVParams` and represents a collection of parameters separated by pipes. It has the same constructors as `CSVParams`, but overrides the `toString()` method to join the parameters into a pipe-separated string.\n\nThese classes can be used in the larger project to format collections of parameters for use in REST API requests.

The `hint` field is an enum that can take one of three values: `cmtWithSecret`, `cmtReal`, or `cmtSimulated`. The `pubkey` field is of type `SigmaBoolean` and represents the public key of the commitment. The `position` field is a string that represents the position of the commitment. The `type` field is an enum that can take one of two values: `dlog` or `dht`. The `a` field is a string that represents a group element of the commitment, and the `b` field is a string that represents the `b` group element of the commitment (needed for DHT protocol only).\n\nThe `Commitment` class has getter and setter methods for each field. The `hint`, `pubkey`, and `position` fields are required, while the `type`, `a`, and `b` fields are optional. The `Commitment` class also has an `equals` method that compares two `Commitment` objects for equality, a `hashCode` method that returns a hash code value for the object, and a `toString` method that returns a string representation of the object.\n\nThe `Commitment` class can be used in the larger Ergo Node API project to represent prover commitments.

For example, if the project involves creating and verifying zero-knowledge proofs, this class may be used to represent the commitments used in the proofs. Here is an example of how this class may be used:\n\n```\nCommitmentWithSecret commitment = new CommitmentWithSecret();\ncommitment.setValue(\"secret value\");\ncommitment.setRandomness(\"secret randomness\");\n```\n\nIn this example, a new `CommitmentWithSecret` object is created and its `setValue` and `setRandomness` methods are called to set the secret value and randomness used to generate the commitment.

This class extends the `ScanningPredicate` class, which provides additional functionality for scanning Ergo transactions.\n\nThe `ContainsPredicate` class has two properties: `register` and `bytes`. The `register` property is a string that specifies the register to scan, while the `bytes` property is a required string that specifies the byte sequence to search for.\n\nThis class provides methods to set and get the values of these properties. The `register` property can be set using the `register()` method, while the `bytes` property can be set using the `bytes()` method. Both methods return the `ContainsPredicate` object, which allows for method chaining.\n\nThe `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` methods are also implemented in this class. These methods are used to compare two `ContainsPredicate` objects for equality, generate a hash code for the object, and convert the object to a string representation, respectively.\n\nOverall, the `ContainsPredicate` class is a useful tool for scanning Ergo transactions for specific byte sequences in a given register.

The `validationSettings` field is a string that represents the validation parameters passed to `Interpreter.verify` to detect soft-fork conditions. The `costLimit` field is a hard limit on the accumulated execution cost, and if exceeded, leads to a `CostLimitException` being thrown. The `initCost` field is the initial value of the execution cost already accumulated before `Interpreter.verify` is called.\n\nThis class is generated by the Swagger code generator program and should not be edited manually.

The `tx()` method sets the value of the `tx` field and returns the instance of the class. The `secrets()` method sets the value of the `secrets` field and returns the instance of the class. The `inputsRaw()` method sets the value of the `inputsRaw` field and returns the instance of the class. The `addInputsRawItem()` method adds an item to the `inputsRaw` list and returns the instance of the class. The `dataInputsRaw()` method sets the value of the `dataInputsRaw` field and returns the instance of the class. The `addDataInputsRawItem()` method adds an item to the `dataInputsRaw` list and returns the instance of the class. \n\nThis class is used in the larger Ergo Node API project to generate commitments to sign a transaction. It can be used by developers who are building applications on top of the Ergo platform to ensure that transactions are signed correctly. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nUnsignedErgoTransaction tx = new UnsignedErgoTransaction();\nGenerateCommitmentsRequestSecrets secrets = new GenerateCommitmentsRequestSecrets();\nList<String> inputsRaw = new ArrayList<String>();\nList<String> dataInputsRaw = new ArrayList<String>();\n\nGenerateCommitmentsRequest request = new GenerateCommitmentsRequest()\n    .tx(tx)\n    .secrets(secrets)\n    .inputsRaw(inputsRaw)\n    .dataInputsRaw(dataInputsRaw);\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

The `leaf` property is a base16-encoded Merkle tree leaf bytes. The `levels` property is a list of lists that represents the Merkle proof levels. Each level is a list of nodes that are hashed together to produce the parent node of the next level.

The `trackingRule` property is an instance of the `ScanningPredicate` class, which represents the predicate used to track the scan.\n\nThe `Scan` class provides getter and setter methods for each property, allowing the properties to be accessed and modified as needed. It also provides methods for equality checking, hashing, and string representation.\n\nThis class can be used in the larger Ergo Node API project to represent a scanning operation. For example, it could be used to create a new scan by setting the `scanName` and `trackingRule` properties and then sending the `Scan` object to the server. It could also be used to retrieve information about an existing scan by retrieving the `scanId` property and sending a request to the server with that ID.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```java\n// Create a new scan\nScan scan = new Scan()\n    .scanName(\"My Scan\")\n    .trackingRule(new ScanningPredicate());\n\n// Send the scan to the server\nScan createdScan = api.createScan(scan);\n\n// Retrieve information about an existing scan\nScan existingScan = api.getScanById(123);\nSystem.out.println(existingScan.getScanName());\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

The methods in this interface allow for registering and deregistering scans, adding boxes to scans, and listing unspent boxes for a given scan. \n\nThe `addBox` method adds a box to a scan and writes it to the database if it is not already there. The `deregisterScan` method stops tracking and deregisters a scan. The `listAllScans` method lists all registered scans. The `listUnspentScans` method lists boxes that are not spent for a given scan, with optional parameters for minimum confirmations and inclusion height. The `registerScan` method registers a new scan. Finally, the `scanStopTracking` method stops tracking a box related to a scan.\n\nThese methods can be used to build applications that interact with the Ergo blockchain. For example, an application that needs to track unspent boxes for a specific scan can use the `listUnspentScans` method to retrieve the necessary information. Similarly, an application that needs to add a box to a scan can use the `addBox` method to accomplish this. \n\nHere is an example of how the `listUnspentScans` method can be used:\n\n```java\nScanApi scanApi = retrofit.create(ScanApi.class);\nCall<List<WalletBox>> call = scanApi.listUnspentScans(scanId, minConfirmations, minInclusionHeight);\nResponse<List<WalletBox>> response = call.execute();\nList<WalletBox> unspentBoxes = response.body();\n```\n\nIn this example, `scanId` is the identifier of the scan for which unspent boxes should be retrieved, `minConfirmations` is the minimum number of confirmations required for a box to be considered unspent (default is 0), and `minInclusionHeight` is the minimum inclusion height required for a box to be considered unspent (default is 0). The `execute` method is called on the `Call` object to make the API request, and the resulting `List` of `WalletBox` objects is retrieved from the response body.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines an interface for making API calls related to scanning and tracking boxes in the Ergo blockchain.\n\n2. What are the required parameters for the `addBox` method?\n- The `addBox` method requires a `ScanIdsBox` object to be passed in the request body.\n\n3.

The class has a single field called `scanId` which is an integer representing the ID of the scan. \n\nThe class provides a getter and a setter method for the `scanId` field. The `getScanId()` method returns the value of the `scanId` field, while the `setScanId()` method sets the value of the `scanId` field. \n\nThe class also provides methods for equality checking, hashing, and string representation. The `equals()` method checks if two `ScanId` objects are equal by comparing their `scanId` fields. The `hashCode()` method returns a hash code value for the `ScanId` object based on its `scanId` field. The `toString()` method returns a string representation of the `ScanId` object, including its `scanId` field.\n\nThis class can be used in the larger Ergo Node API project to represent a scan ID in various API requests and responses. For example, a request to get information about a specific scan may include a `ScanId` object as a parameter, while a response from the API may include a `ScanId` object as a field in a JSON object. \n\nHere is an example of how this class can be used:\n\n```\nScanId scanId = new ScanId();\nscanId.setScanId(12345);\nint id = scanId.getScanId();\nSystem.out.println(\"Scan ID: \" + id);\n```\n\nThis code creates a new `ScanId` object, sets its `scanId` field to 12345, gets the value of the `scanId` field using the `getScanId()` method, and prints it to the console.

It also provides a `hashCode` method for generating a hash code based on the `scanId` and `boxId` values, and a `toString` method for generating a string representation of the object.\n\nThis class is used in other parts of the Ergo Node API to uniquely identify scanned boxes. For example, it may be used in a request to retrieve information about a specific box that has been scanned, or to update the status of a box that has been scanned. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nScanIdBoxId scanIdBoxId = new ScanIdBoxId();\nscanIdBoxId.setScanId(123);\nscanIdBoxId.setBoxId(\"abc123\");\n\nSystem.out.println(scanIdBoxId.getScanId()); // Output: 123\nSystem.out.println(scanIdBoxId.getBoxId()); // Output: abc123\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

The `scanIds` field can be set using the `scanIds` method, which takes a list of integers as input. The `addScanIdsItem` method can be used to add individual integers to the `scanIds` list. The `getScanIds` method returns the list of scan IDs.\n\nThe `box` field can be set using the `box` method, which takes an instance of the `ErgoTransactionOutput` class as input. The `getBox` method returns the `ErgoTransactionOutput` instance.\n\nThe `ScanIdsBox` class also provides methods to override the `equals`, `hashCode`, and `toString` methods inherited from the `Object` class.

This class extends the `SigmaBoolean` class and adds a list of `SigmaBoolean` objects as arguments to the OR predicate. \n\nThe purpose of this class is to provide a way to represent complex boolean expressions in the Sigma protocol. The `SigmaBooleanOrPredicate` class can be used to construct complex boolean expressions by combining multiple `SigmaBoolean` objects using the OR operator. \n\nFor example, suppose we have two `SigmaBoolean` objects `A` and `B`.

The first method, `containsIgnoreCase`, takes an array of strings and a value to search for, and returns true if the array contains the value (case-insensitive comparison). If the value is null, the method returns true if any element in the array is also null. This method can be useful for checking if a certain value is present in an array of strings, regardless of case.\n\nExample usage:\n```\nString[] fruits = {\"apple\", \"banana\", \"orange\"};\nboolean containsApple = StringUtil.containsIgnoreCase(fruits, \"Apple\"); // returns true\nboolean containsGrape = StringUtil.containsIgnoreCase(fruits, \"grape\"); // returns false\n```\n\nThe second method, `join`, takes an array of strings and a separator, and returns a string that concatenates all the elements in the array with the separator in between.

The `username` and `password` variables store the username and password for the Basic Authentication header, respectively. The `credentials` variable is a convenience method for setting both the `username` and `password` at the same time.\n\nThe `intercept` method is the heart of this class. It takes an `Interceptor.Chain` object as a parameter, which represents the chain of interceptors that will be applied to the request. It then retrieves the original request from the chain and checks if it already has an Authorization header. If it does not, it creates a new request with the Authorization header set to the Basic Authentication credentials using the `Credentials.basic` method from the `okhttp3` library. Finally, it returns the result of calling `chain.proceed(request)`, which sends the modified request down the interceptor chain.\n\nThis class can be used in conjunction with an `OkHttpClient` instance to add Basic Authentication headers to outgoing requests.

What library or libraries does this code depend on?\n    \n    This code depends on the OkHttp library for handling HTTP requests and responses.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/java-client-generated/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/restapi/client/auth/HttpBasicAuth.md"}}],["239",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-appkit/.autodoc/docs/json/java-client-generated/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/restapi/client/auth)\n\nThe `org.ergoplatform.restapi.client.auth` package contains two classes, `ApiKeyAuth` and `HttpBasicAuth`, which are responsible for adding authentication information to outgoing HTTP requests made by the `OkHttpClient` instance. Both classes implement the `Interceptor` interface from the `okhttp3` library, allowing them to intercept and modify requests before they are sent to the server.\n\nThe `ApiKeyAuth` class is used for APIs that require an API key for authentication. It takes two arguments in its constructor: `location` and `paramName`. `location` specifies where the API key should be added - either as a query parameter or a header. `paramName` specifies the name of the query parameter or header that should be used to send the API key. The API key itself is stored as a private field in the class and can be set using the `setApiKey` method. The `intercept` method modifies the request by adding the API key to the specified location.\n\nExample usage of `ApiKeyAuth`:\n\n```java\nOkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient.Builder()\n        .addInterceptor(new ApiKeyAuth(\"header\", \"X-Api-Key\"))\n        .build();\n\nRequest request = new Request.Builder()\n        .url(\"https://api.example.com/some-endpoint\")\n        .build();\n\nResponse response = client.newCall(request).execute();\n```\n\nThe `HttpBasicAuth` class is used for APIs that require HTTP Basic Authentication. It has three instance variables: `username`, `password`, and `credentials`. The `intercept` method retrieves the original request from the interceptor chain and checks if it already has an Authorization header. If it does not, it creates a new request with the Authorization header set to the Basic Authentication credentials using the `Credentials.basic` method from the `okhttp3` library.\n\nExample usage of `HttpBasicAuth`:\n\n```java\nOkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient.Builder()\n        .addInterceptor(new HttpBasicAuth())\n        .build();\n\nRequest request = new Request.Builder()\n        .url(\"https://example.com/api\")\n        .build();\n\nResponse response = client.newCall(request).execute();\n```\n\nIn both examples, we create a new `OkHttpClient` instance and add an instance of the respective authentication interceptor. We then create a new `Request` object with the desired URL and send it using the `OkHttpClient`. The authentication interceptor will automatically add the required authentication information to the request before it is sent.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/java-client-generated/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/restapi/client/auth/summary.md"}}],["240",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-appkit/.autodoc/docs/json/java-client-generated/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/restapi)\n\nThe `.autodoc/docs/json/java-client-generated/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/restapi` folder contains the Java classes that are generated from the Ergo Platform REST API specification. These classes are used to interact with the Ergo blockchain through the REST API, allowing developers to easily integrate Ergo functionality into their Java applications.\n\n### Files\n\n1. `ApiClient.java`: This file contains the `ApiClient` class, which is responsible for managing the communication with the Ergo REST API. It handles HTTP requests, authentication, and serialization/deserialization of JSON data.\n\n2. `ApiException.java`: This file contains the `ApiException` class, which is a custom exception class used to handle errors that occur during API calls. It provides detailed information about the error, such as the HTTP status code and the error message.\n\n3. `Configuration.java`: This file contains the `Configuration` class, which is used to configure the `ApiClient`. It allows developers to set various options, such as the API base path, authentication credentials, and timeouts.\n\n4. `GsonAdaptersModel.java`: This file contains the `GsonAdaptersModel` class, which is used to register custom Gson type adapters for the serialization and deserialization of JSON data. This ensures that the Java classes can be correctly mapped to the JSON data returned by the Ergo REST API.\n\n5. `Pair.java`: This file contains the `Pair` class, which is a simple utility class used to store a pair of values. It is used internally by the `ApiClient` class to manage query parameters and form data.\n\n6. `ProgressRequestBody.java` and `ProgressResponseBody.java`: These files contain the `ProgressRequestBody` and `ProgressResponseBody` classes, which are used to monitor the progress of file uploads and downloads during API calls. They extend the OkHttp `RequestBody` and `ResponseBody` classes and provide progress callbacks.\n\n### Usage\n\nTo use the Java client generated from the Ergo REST API, you would first create an instance of the `ApiClient` class and configure it using the `Configuration` class.

The getDataSource() method returns a BlockchainDataSource object, which is used to fetch data from the blockchain. The execute() method takes a Function object as an argument, which represents some action to be performed on the blockchain. The execute() method creates a BlockchainContext object, which represents the current state of the blockchain, and passes it to the action. The action returns a result of type T, which is then returned by the execute() method.\n\nThe ErgoClient interface is designed to be used as a runner of some action in a blockchain context. The BlockchainContext object is created by the specific ErgoClient implementation and passed to the action. This allows the action to interact with the blockchain in a consistent way, regardless of the specific implementation used.\n\nThe ErgoClient interface is intended to be implemented by different classes, each of which represents a different way of interacting with the Ergo blockchain. For example, one implementation might use the Ergo REST API to communicate with the blockchain, while another might use a direct connection to a node running in the same JVM. The actual implementation used to fetch data can be accessed from the BlockchainDataSource object returned by the getDataSource() method.\n\nOverall, the ErgoClient interface provides a high-level abstraction for interacting with the Ergo blockchain, allowing developers to write code that is independent of the specific implementation used. This makes it easier to write code that can be reused across different projects and environments. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\n// create an instance of ErgoClient\nErgoClient client = new MyErgoClient();\n\n// define an action to be performed on the blockchain\nFunction<BlockchainContext, Integer> action = (context) -> {\n    // perform some operation on the blockchain\n    int result = context.getHeight();\n    return result;\n};\n\n// execute the action using the ErgoClient\nint result = client.execute(action);\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

The `sign()` method with two parameters signs an unsigned transaction and takes a `baseCost` parameter that represents the computational cost before the transaction validation. The `signMessage()` method signs an arbitrary message under a key representing a statement provable via a sigma-protocol. The `reduce()` method reduces an unsigned transaction to a reduced transaction.

The `ErgoProver` is used to generate proofs for spending Ergo tokens. The `ErgoProverBuilder` interface provides several methods to configure the `ErgoProver` instance.\n\nThe `withMnemonic` method is used to configure the `ErgoProverBuilder` to use a secret seed phrase and password to generate proofs. The `usePre1627KeyDerivation` parameter is used to specify whether to use the previous BIP32 derivation or not. The `withMnemonic` method can also be used to configure the `ErgoProverBuilder` to use a `Mnemonic` instance containing the secret seed phrase.\n\nThe `withEip3Secret` method is used to configure the `ErgoProverBuilder` to derive the new EIP-3 secret key with the given index. The derivation uses the master key derived from the mnemonic configured using the `withMnemonic` method.\n\nThe `withSecretStorage` method is used to configure the `ErgoProverBuilder` to use a `SecretStorage` instance containing an encrypted secret seed phrase to generate proofs.\n\nThe `withDHTData` method is used to configure the `ErgoProverBuilder` to use group elements and a secret integer for a ProveDHTuple statement when building a new `ErgoProver`. The ProveDHTuple statement consists of 4 group elements and requires the prover to prove knowledge of a secret integer. The `withDLogSecret` method is used to add additional secrets for use in proveDlog when the secret is not part of the wallet.\n\nThe `build` method is used to build a new `ErgoProver` instance using the provided configuration.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nErgoProverBuilder builder = new ErgoProverBuilderImpl();\nbuilder.withMnemonic(mnemonicPhrase, mnemonicPass, false);\nbuilder.withEip3Secret(0);\nErgoProver prover = builder.build();\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

What is the difference between `withMnemonic(SecretString, SecretString, Boolean)` and `withMnemonic(Mnemonic, Boolean)` methods?\n- The first method takes a secret seed phrase and its password as separate arguments, while the second method takes a Mnemonic instance containing the seed phrase and its password. Additionally, the first method allows specifying whether to use an incorrect BIP32 derivation for old wallets, while the second method assumes the correct derivation for old wallets.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `withDHTData` method?\n- This method configures the builder to use group elements and a secret integer for a ProveDHTuple statement, which requires proving knowledge of the secret integer x such that u = g^x and y = h^x.

It is part of the `ergo-appkit` project and is used to build transactions. Unlike the `DefaultBoxSelector` from `ergo-wallet`, this selector does not select input boxes. Instead, it validates the input boxes and calculates the necessary change box.\n\nThe `InputBoxesValidator` class extends the `BoxSelector` trait and overrides its `select` method. The `select` method takes an iterator of input boxes, an external filter, a target balance, and target assets. It returns either a `BoxSelectionResult` or a `BoxSelectionError`. The `BoxSelectionResult` contains the selected input boxes and the change boxes, while the `BoxSelectionError` contains an error message.\n\nThe `InputBoxesValidator` class also has a `formChangeBoxes` method that constructs change outputs. It takes the found balance, target balance, found box assets, and target box assets. It returns either a sequence of `ErgoBoxAssets` or a `BoxSelectionError`. The `ErgoBoxAssets` contains the balance and assets of a box.\n\nThe `InputBoxesValidator` class uses mutable structures to collect results. It selects all input boxes and validates them. It then checks if it found all the required tokens. If it did, it constructs the change boxes using the `formChangeBoxes` method. If it did not, it returns a `NotEnoughTokensError`. If it did not find enough ERGs, it returns a `NotEnoughErgsError`.\n\nIn summary, the `InputBoxesValidator` class is a box selector implementation that performs validation and calculates the necessary change box. It is used to build transactions in the `ergo-appkit` project. It selects all input boxes, validates them, and constructs the change boxes. If it encounters an error, it returns a `BoxSelectionError`.\n## Questions: \n 1.

What happens if there are not enough tokens in the input boxes to send the target assets?\n- If there are not enough tokens in the input boxes to send the target assets, the code will return a NotEnoughTokensError with a message indicating that there are not enough tokens in the input boxes to send the target assets.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/lib-api/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/appkit/InputBoxesValidator.md"}}],["263",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-appkit/lib-api/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/appkit/InputBoxesValidatorJavaHelper.scala)\n\nThe `InputBoxesValidatorJavaHelper` object provides a method for validating a list of unspent input boxes to ensure they contain enough funds and tokens to cover a specified amount and set of tokens. This is useful for constructing transactions in the Ergo blockchain.\n\nThe `validateBoxes` method takes three arguments: a list of `InputBox` objects representing unspent boxes, a `Long` amount to spend, and a list of `ErgoToken` objects representing the tokens to spend. The method first converts the `unspentBoxes` and `tokensToSpend` arguments to Scala collections using the `convertTo` method from the `Iso` object. It then creates a `targetAssets` map from the `tokensToSpend` argument. \n\nThe method then calls the `select` method of an `InputBoxesValidator` object with the converted `inputBoxes`, `amountToSpend`, and `targetAssets` arguments. The `select` method returns either a `Left` value representing an error or a `Right` value representing a successful selection of input boxes. \n\nIf the `select` method returns a `Left` value, the method throws an exception based on the type of error. If the error is a `NotEnoughCoinsForChangeBoxesError`, the method throws a `NotEnoughCoinsForChangeException`. If the error is a `NotEnoughErgsError`, the method checks if the balance found in the input boxes is greater than or equal to the amount to spend. If it is, the method throws a `NotEnoughCoinsForChangeException`. Otherwise, the method throws a `NotEnoughErgsException`. If the error is a `NotEnoughTokensError`, the method creates a `HashMap` of token IDs and values and throws a `NotEnoughTokensException`. If the error is any other type of error, the method throws an `InputBoxesSelectionException`.\n\nIf the `select` method returns a `Right` value, the method does nothing and returns `Unit`.\n\nOverall, this code provides a useful utility for validating input boxes for constructing transactions in the Ergo blockchain. Here is an example usage of the `validateBoxes` method:\n\n```scala\nimport org.ergoplatform.appkit._\n\nval unspentBoxes: java.util.List[InputBox] = ???\nval amountToSpend: Long = ???\nval tokensToSpend: java.util.List[ErgoToken] = ???\n\nInputBoxesValidatorJavaHelper.validateBoxes(unspentBoxes, amountToSpend, tokensToSpend)\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

The first method, `getBytesWithNoRef()`, returns the serialized bytes of this output box without any transaction reference data. This method can be used to get the serialized bytes of the output box, which can be useful for debugging purposes or for sending the output box to another node. \n\nThe second method, `convertToInputWith(String txId, short outputIndex)`, converts this box candidate into a new instance of `InputBox` by associating it with the given transaction and output position. This method can be used to create input boxes from scratch, without retrieving them from the UTXOs. Thus created boxes can be indistinguishable from those loaded from the blockchain node, and as a result, can be used to create new transactions.

The `value` method is used to configure the Erg amount of the output box. The `contract` method is used to configure the guarding contract of the output box. This contract will be compiled into ErgoTree, serialized, and then sent to the blockchain as part of the signed transaction. The `tokens` method is used to configure amounts for one or more tokens. Each Ergo box can store zero or more tokens. The `mintToken` method is used to mint a new token according to the EIP-0004 standard. The `registers` method is used to configure one or more optional registers of the output box. Each box has 4 mandatory registers holding the value of NanoErgs, guarding script, tokens, and creation info. Optional registers numbered from index 4 up to 9.

The `tokens` method is used to set the amounts for two tokens. The `registers` method is used to set two optional registers of the output box. The `creationHeight` method is used to set the height when the transaction containing the box was created to 1000.

The purpose of this interface is to define the header fields that can be predicted by a miner. The PreHeader interface has seven methods that define the fields of a block header. These fields include the block version, the ID of the parent block, the block timestamp, the current difficulty, the block height, the miner public key, and the votes.\n\nThe getVersion() method returns the version of the block, which is incremented on every soft and hard fork.

Finally, the getVotes() method returns the votes for the block.\n\nThis interface can be used in the larger project to define the header of a block. By implementing this interface, developers can ensure that the header fields are consistent with the requirements of the ergo-appkit project. For example, a developer can create a class that implements the PreHeader interface and defines the header fields for a block. This class can then be used to create a block and submit it to the network.\n\nHere is an example of how this interface can be used:\n\n```\npublic class MyBlockHeader implements PreHeader {\n    private byte version;\n    private Coll<Byte> parentId;\n    private long timestamp;\n    private long nBits;\n    private int height;\n    private GroupElement minerPk;\n    private Coll<Byte> votes;\n\n    public MyBlockHeader(byte version, Coll<Byte> parentId, long timestamp, long nBits, int height, GroupElement minerPk, Coll<Byte> votes) {\n        this.version = version;\n        this.parentId = parentId;\n        this.timestamp = timestamp;\n        this.nBits = nBits;\n        this.height = height;\n        this.minerPk = minerPk;\n        this.votes = votes;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public byte getVersion() {\n        return version;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public Coll<Byte> getParentId() {\n        return parentId;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public long getTimestamp() {\n        return timestamp;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public long getNBits() {\n        return nBits;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public int getHeight() {\n        return height;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public GroupElement getMinerPk() {\n        return minerPk;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public Coll<Byte> getVotes() {\n        return votes;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, a class called MyBlockHeader implements the PreHeader interface.

The methods of the PreHeader interface are then implemented to return the corresponding instance variables. This class can then be used to create a block header and submit it to the network.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `special.collection.Coll` and `special.sigma.GroupElement` imports?\n- A smart developer might wonder what these imports are used for and how they relate to the `PreHeader` interface. These imports are likely used for data structures and cryptographic operations within the `PreHeader` interface.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `getVotes()` method?\n- A smart developer might question why the `getVotes()` method is included in the `PreHeader` interface and what it returns.

What is the expected output of the `build()` method?\n    \n    The `build()` method is expected to return a `PreHeader` object, which can be used for transaction signing.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/lib-api/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/appkit/PreHeaderBuilder.md"}}],["268",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-appkit/lib-api/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/appkit/ReducedTransaction.java)\n\nThe `ReducedTransaction` interface is a part of the `ergo-appkit` project and is used to represent an unsigned transaction that has been reduced. A reduced transaction is an unsigned transaction that has been augmented with one `ReductionResult` for each `UnsignedInput`. The `ReducedTransaction` interface extends the `Transaction` interface, which means that it inherits all the methods of the `Transaction` interface.\n\nThe `ReducedTransaction` interface has three methods: `getTx()`, `getCost()`, and `toBytes()`. The `getTx()` method returns the underlying reduced transaction data. The `getCost()` method returns the cost accumulated while reducing the original unsigned transaction. The `toBytes()` method returns the serialized bytes of this transaction.\n\nThe `ReducedTransaction` interface can be used in the larger project to represent an unsigned transaction that has been reduced. For example, the `ReducedTransaction` interface can be used in a smart contract that requires an unsigned transaction to be reduced before it can be executed. The `ReducedTransaction` interface can also be used in a wallet application that allows users to create and sign transactions.\n\nHere is an example of how the `ReducedTransaction` interface can be used:\n\n```\n// create an unsigned transaction\nUnsignedTransaction unsignedTx = new UnsignedTransaction(inputs, outputs);\n\n// reduce the unsigned transaction\nReducedTransaction reducedTx = unsignedTx.reduce();\n\n// get the underlying reduced transaction data\nReducedErgoLikeTransaction reducedData = reducedTx.getTx();\n\n// get the cost accumulated while reducing the original unsigned transaction\nint cost = reducedTx.getCost();\n\n// serialize the reduced transaction\nbyte[] serializedTx = reducedTx.toBytes();\n```\n\nIn this example, we create an unsigned transaction using the `UnsignedTransaction` class. We then reduce the unsigned transaction using the `reduce()` method, which returns a `ReducedTransaction` object. We can then use the methods of the `ReducedTransaction` interface to get the underlying reduced transaction data, the cost accumulated while reducing the original unsigned transaction, and the serialized bytes of the reduced transaction.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of this interface and how is it used in the ergo-appkit project?\n   - This interface represents an unsigned transaction that has been reduced and augmented with a `ReductionResult` for each `UnsignedInput`. It can be obtained by reducing an unsigned transaction. It is used to provide access to the reduced transaction data, cost, and serialized bytes.\n2. What is a `ReducedErgoLikeTransaction` and how is it related to this interface?\n   - `ReducedErgoLikeTransaction` is the underlying reduced transaction data that can be accessed through the `getTx()` method of this interface. It contains the reduced inputs and outputs of the original unsigned transaction.\n3. How is the cost of reducing the original unsigned transaction calculated and what does it represent?\n   - The cost of reducing the original unsigned transaction can be obtained through the `getCost()` method of this interface. It represents the amount of resources (e.g. time, memory) required to perform the reduction process.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/lib-api/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/appkit/ReducedTransaction.md"}}],["269",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-appkit/lib-api/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/appkit/SignedInput.java)\n\nThe code above defines an interface called `SignedInput` which represents an input of a `SignedTransaction`. A `SignedInput` contains information necessary to spend the input, including proofs of knowledge of necessary secrets (aka signatures). These proofs are generated by an `ErgoProver` configured with the secrets. When the transaction is validated, the proofs are verified (this is a generalization of a signature verification). \n\nThe `SignedInput` interface has four methods. The `getProofBytes()` method returns the bytes of the generated proofs (aka generalized signature). The `getContextVars()` method returns context variables attached by the prover to this input. These variables will be passed to the contract which protects this input. Each variable is accessible by id using the `getVar` function of ErgoScript. The `getId()` method returns the id of the box, which will be spent by the transaction. Finally, the `getTransaction()` method returns the transaction which contains this input.\n\nThis interface is an important part of the `ergo-appkit` project as it allows developers to create and manipulate `SignedInput` objects, which are necessary for creating and validating transactions on the Ergo blockchain. For example, a developer could create a `SignedInput` object and set its `proofBytes` and `contextVars` fields to the appropriate values, then add it to a `SignedTransaction` object using the `addInput()` method. The `SignedTransaction` object could then be signed and broadcast to the network using the `ErgoClient` class. \n\nOverall, the `SignedInput` interface provides a way for developers to interact with inputs in a transaction, including providing the necessary proofs and context variables for validation.\n## Questions: \n 1.

It extends the `Transaction` interface and provides additional methods for working with signed transactions.\n\nThe `toJson` method returns a JSON representation of the transaction. It takes a boolean parameter `prettyPrint` which determines whether the ErgoTrees will be pretty printed or output as hex strings. There is also an overloaded version of this method that takes an additional boolean parameter `formatJson` which determines whether the JSON output will be pretty printed.\n\nThe `getSignedInputs` method returns a list of all signed inputs that will be spent when the transaction is included in the blockchain. Each signed input has an attached signature (proof) that evidences that the prover knows the required secrets.\n\nThe `getOutputsToSpend` method returns a list of outputs of the transaction represented as `InputBox` objects ready to be spent in the next chained transaction. This method can be used to create a chain of transactions.\n\nThe `getCost` method returns the estimated cost of the transaction. Note that this cost is only an approximation of the actual cost of the transaction, which may depend on the blockchain context.\n\nThe `toBytes` method returns the serialized bytes of the transaction.\n\nOverall, the `SignedTransaction` interface provides a way to work with signed transactions in the Ergo platform. It can be used to create, sign, and send transactions to the blockchain. For example, a developer could use this interface to create a new transaction, sign it with a prover, and then send it to the blockchain using the `ErgoClient` class provided by the `ergo-appkit` project.\n## Questions: \n 1.

This interface provides methods that are available for all types of transactions, including `ReducedTransaction`, `SignedTransaction`, and `UnsignedTransaction`.\n\nThe `getId()` method returns the transaction ID as a Base16 string. The transaction ID is a unique identifier for the transaction and is used to reference the transaction in other parts of the Ergo platform.\n\nThe `getInputBoxesIds()` method returns a list of input box IDs for the transaction. In the Ergo platform, a box is a container for tokens and can be thought of as a digital asset. The input boxes for a transaction are the boxes that are being spent in the transaction.\n\nThe `getOutputs()` method returns a list of output boxes that will be created by the transaction. These output boxes represent the new boxes that are being created as a result of the transaction. Each output box contains a set of tokens and can be thought of as a new digital asset that is being created.\n\nThis interface is an important part of the Ergo Appkit project as it provides a standardized way to interact with transactions in the Ergo platform. Developers can use this interface to build applications that interact with the Ergo blockchain, such as wallets, exchanges, and other financial applications.\n\nHere is an example of how this interface can be used in a Java application:\n\n```\nimport org.ergoplatform.appkit.*;\n\npublic class MyTransaction {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // create a new transaction\n        Transaction tx = new UnsignedTransaction();\n\n        // get the transaction ID\n        String txId = tx.getId();\n\n        // get the input box IDs\n        List<String> inputBoxIds = tx.getInputBoxesIds();\n\n        // get the output boxes\n        List<OutBox> outputBoxes = tx.getOutputs();\n\n        // do something with the transaction data\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we create a new `UnsignedTransaction` object and use the methods provided by the `Transaction` interface to get the transaction ID, input box IDs, and output boxes. We can then use this data to perform some action in our application.\n## Questions: \n 1.

This interface provides several methods to retrieve information about the box, such as its value, creation height, tokens, registers, ErgoTree, and BoxAttachment.\n\nThe `getValue()` method returns the nanoERG value stored in the box, which represents the unspent value in UTXO. The `getCreationHeight()` method returns the height (block number) when the transaction containing this output box was created. The `getTokens()` method returns a list of `ErgoToken` objects stored in the box. The `getRegisters()` method returns a list of `ErgoValue` objects representing the values of the non-mandatory registers which are stored in the box (R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9). The index 0 corresponds to R4, 1 corresponds to R5, and so on. The `getErgoTree()` method returns the `ErgoTree` of the script guarding the box. Finally, the `getAttachment()` method returns the `BoxAttachment` stored in this box or null.\n\nThis interface is likely to be used extensively in the Ergo platform, which is a blockchain platform for creating decentralized applications. Developers can use this interface to retrieve information about boxes on a transaction, which can be used to implement various features of their applications. For example, a developer might use the `getValue()` method to calculate the total value of a transaction, or the `getTokens()` method to retrieve information about the tokens involved in a transaction. The `getErgoTree()` method can be used to retrieve the script guarding a box, which can be used to verify the validity of a transaction.

It is likely used throughout the ergo-appkit project to interact with transaction boxes.\n\n2.

The prover should be constructed by the `ErgoProverBuilder` obtained from the same `BlockchainContext`.\n\nThis interface provides several methods to add inputs, data inputs, outputs, transaction fees, tokens to burn, and change outputs to the transaction. The `addInputs` method adds input boxes to an already specified list of inputs or, if no input boxes are defined yet, as the boxes to spend. The `addDataInputs` method adds input boxes to an already specified list of data inputs or, if no data input boxes are defined yet, sets the boxes as the data input boxes to be used.

Each of these methods sets a specific property of the `BabelFeeBoxState` object. \n\nThe `withPricePerToken` method sets the price per token of the `BabelFeeBoxState` object. The `withTokenId` method sets the ID of the token that the `BabelFeeBoxState` object contains. The `withBoxCreator` method sets the creator of the `BabelFeeBoxState` object.

These fields are set using the various setter methods provided by the class. The `version` field represents the version of the block header. The `parentId` field represents the hash of the parent block header. The `timestamp` field represents the timestamp of the block header. The `nBits` field represents the difficulty target of the block header. The `height` field represents the height of the block header.

If `formatJson` is true, the output JSON is formatted with a consistent style. \n\nHere is an example of how to use the `SignedTransactionImpl` class:\n\n```java\nBlockchainContext ctx = ...; // create a blockchain context\nErgoLikeTransaction tx = ...; // create a signed transaction\nint txCost = ...; // set the cost of the transaction\nSignedTransaction signedTx = new SignedTransactionImpl(ctx, tx, txCost);\n\n// get the ID of the transaction\nString txId = signedTx.getId();\n\n// get the transaction in JSON format\nString txJson = signedTx.toJson(true, true);\n\n// get a list of signed inputs\nList<SignedInput> signedInputs = signedTx.getSignedInputs();\n\n// get a list of output boxes that can be spent\nList<InputBox> outputsToSpend = signedTx.getOutputsToSpend();\n\n// get a list of input box IDs\nList<String> inputBoxIds = signedTx.getInputBoxesIds();\n\n// get a list of output boxes\nList<OutBox> outputs = signedTx.getOutputs();\n\n// get the cost of the transaction\nint txCost = signedTx.getCost();\n\n// get the transaction in byte format\nbyte[] txBytes = signedTx.toBytes();\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

For example, the `org.ergoplatform.restapi.client.BlocksApi` class is represented with its `getLastHeaders` method exposed:\n\n```java\nimport org.ergoplatform.restapi.client.BlocksApi;\n\nBlocksApi blocksApi = new BlocksApi();\nBigDecimal headersCount = new BigDecimal(10);\nList<BlockHeader> lastHeaders = blocksApi.getLastHeaders(headersCount);\n```\n\n4. `resource-config.json`: This file defines a list of resources for the project, such as configuration files and library properties files. These resources are specified by patterns, which indicate their locations. For instance, to access the location of the `reference.conf` file, the following code could be used:\n\n```java\nString referenceConfLocation = resources.get(0).get(\"pattern\");\n```\n\nIn summary, the `.autodoc/docs/json/src/main/resources` folder contains JSON configuration files that are vital for the ergo-appkit project. These files help in defining resources, classes, and methods, which are essential for organizing and accessing various components of the project, ensuring efficient development and usage.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/src/summary.md"}}],["329",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-appkit/storage/E1.json)\n\nThe code provided is a JSON object that contains encryption-related information. Specifically, it contains the ciphertext, salt, initialization vector (IV), authentication tag, and cipher parameters. This information is likely used in the larger project to encrypt and decrypt sensitive data.\n\nThe ciphertext is the encrypted version of the original plaintext. The salt is a random value that is used to prevent attackers from precomputing the key needed to decrypt the ciphertext. The IV is another random value that is used to ensure that the same plaintext does not always result in the same ciphertext. The authentication tag is used to ensure that the ciphertext has not been tampered with during transmission or storage.\n\nThe cipher parameters provide additional information about the encryption process. The \"prf\" parameter specifies the pseudorandom function used to derive the key from the password. The \"c\" parameter specifies the number of iterations used in the key derivation process. The \"dkLen\" parameter specifies the length of the derived key.\n\nTo use this information to decrypt the ciphertext, the project likely uses a cryptographic library that supports the same encryption algorithm and mode as the one used to encrypt the data.
