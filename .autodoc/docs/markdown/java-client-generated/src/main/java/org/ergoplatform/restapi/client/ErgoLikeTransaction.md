The `ErgoLikeTransaction` class is part of the `ergo-appkit` project and is used to model an Ergo transaction. It contains four fields: `id`, `inputs`, `dataInputs`, and `outputs`. 

The `id` field is a string that represents the transaction ID. The `inputs` field is a list of `ErgoTransactionInput` objects, which represent the inputs to the transaction. The `dataInputs` field is a list of `ErgoTransactionDataInput` objects, which represent the data inputs to the transaction. The `outputs` field is a list of `ErgoTransactionOutput` objects, which represent the outputs of the transaction.

This class is generated by the Swagger code generator program and should not be edited manually. It provides methods to set and get the values of its fields. For example, to set the `id` field, you can call the `id` method and pass in a string:

```
ErgoLikeTransaction transaction = new ErgoLikeTransaction();
transaction.id("12345");
```

To add an input to the transaction, you can call the `addInputsItem` method and pass in an `ErgoTransactionInput` object:

```
ErgoTransactionInput input = new ErgoTransactionInput();
transaction.addInputsItem(input);
```

Similarly, to add a data input or an output to the transaction, you can call the `addDataInputsItem` or `addOutputsItem` method, respectively.

Overall, the `ErgoLikeTransaction` class is an important part of the `ergo-appkit` project as it provides a way to model Ergo transactions and interact with them programmatically.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a Java class called `ErgoLikeTransaction` that represents a transaction in the Ergo blockchain.

2. What are the main properties of an `ErgoLikeTransaction` object?
- An `ErgoLikeTransaction` object has four properties: `id`, `inputs`, `dataInputs`, and `outputs`. `id` is a string that uniquely identifies the transaction, while `inputs`, `dataInputs`, and `outputs` are lists of objects representing the inputs, data inputs, and outputs of the transaction, respectively.

3. Can the properties of an `ErgoLikeTransaction` object be modified after it is created?
- Yes, the properties of an `ErgoLikeTransaction` object can be modified using the setter methods provided (`setId()`, `setInputs()`, `setDataInputs()`, and `setOutputs()`), as well as the `addInputsItem()`, `addDataInputsItem()`, and `addOutputsItem()` methods for adding individual items to the corresponding lists.
