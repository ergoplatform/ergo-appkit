The `DataInputInfo` class is part of the Ergo Explorer API v1 and is used to represent information about a data input in a transaction. This class contains various fields that provide information about the data input, such as the ID of the corresponding box, the number of nanoErgs in the corresponding box, the index of the input in a transaction, the ID of the transaction outputting the corresponding box, the index of the output corresponding to this input, the hex-encoded string of the ergo tree, the decoded address of the corresponding box holder, and a list of asset instances.

This class can be used in the larger project to represent data inputs in transactions. For example, if a developer is building a wallet application that interacts with the Ergo blockchain, they can use this class to represent data inputs when constructing transactions. The `DataInputInfo` class provides a convenient way to store and manipulate data input information, making it easier for developers to work with transactions.

Here is an example of how this class can be used:

```java
DataInputInfo dataInput = new DataInputInfo()
    .boxId("12345")
    .value(1000000000L)
    .index(0)
    .outputBlockId("67890")
    .outputTransactionId("54321")
    .outputIndex(1)
    .ergoTree("abcdefg")
    .address("myAddress")
    .addAssetsItem(new AssetInstanceInfo().tokenId("token1").amount(100))
    .addAssetsItem(new AssetInstanceInfo().tokenId("token2").amount(200))
    .additionalRegisters(new AdditionalRegisters().put("key1", "value1").put("key2", "value2"));

System.out.println(dataInput.getBoxId()); // Output: 12345
System.out.println(dataInput.getValue()); // Output: 1000000000
System.out.println(dataInput.getAssets().get(0).getTokenId()); // Output: token1
System.out.println(dataInput.getAdditionalRegisters().get("key1")); // Output: value1
```

In this example, a new `DataInputInfo` object is created and various fields are set using the builder pattern. The `get` methods are then used to retrieve the values of the fields.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code defines a Java class called `DataInputInfo` which represents information about a data input in a blockchain transaction. It contains various properties such as the ID of the corresponding box, the number of nanoErgs in the box, the index of the input in the transaction, and so on.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code rely on?
- This code relies on the `com.google.gson` library for JSON serialization and deserialization, as well as the `io.swagger.v3.oas.annotations` package for OpenAPI annotations.

3. What is the expected input and output format for this code?
- The input format for this code is not specified, as it is a Java class that is meant to be used within a larger application. The output format is a JSON representation of the `DataInputInfo` object, which can be generated using the `com.google.gson` library.
