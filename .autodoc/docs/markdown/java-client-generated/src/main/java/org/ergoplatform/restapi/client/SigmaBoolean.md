The `SigmaBoolean` class is part of the Ergo Node API and is used to represent sigma proposition expressions. Sigma is a scripting language used in the Ergo blockchain to define transaction validation rules. The `SigmaBoolean` class is an algebraic data type that can represent different types of sigma expressions. 

The class has six fields: `op`, `h`, `g`, `u`, `v`, and `condition`. The `op` field is an integer that represents the sigma opcode. The `h`, `g`, `u`, and `v` fields are strings that represent different types of sigma expressions. The `condition` field is a boolean that represents whether the sigma expression is a condition.

The class provides getter and setter methods for each field. The `toString()` method is overridden to provide a string representation of the object. The `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods are also overridden to provide equality comparison based on the object's fields.

This class is generated by the Swagger Codegen program and should not be edited manually. It is used in the larger Ergo Node API project to represent sigma expressions in transactions. Here is an example of how this class might be used in the Ergo Node API:

```java
SigmaBoolean sigmaBoolean = new SigmaBoolean()
    .op(1)
    .h("hash")
    .g("group")
    .u("u")
    .v("v")
    .condition(true);
```

This creates a new `SigmaBoolean` object with the `op` field set to 1, the `h` field set to "hash", the `g` field set to "group", the `u` field set to "u", the `v` field set to "v", and the `condition` field set to true.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a class called `SigmaBoolean` which is an algebraic data type of sigma proposition expressions. It contains various fields and methods to manipulate those fields.

2. What is the significance of the `op` field?
- The `op` field represents the Sigma opCode and is required according to the schema. It is an integer value.

3. What is the purpose of the `toString()` method?
- The `toString()` method is used to convert the `SigmaBoolean` object to a string representation. It is used for debugging and logging purposes.
