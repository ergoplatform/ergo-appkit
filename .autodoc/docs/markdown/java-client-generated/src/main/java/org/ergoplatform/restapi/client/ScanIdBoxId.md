The `ScanIdBoxId` class is a model class that represents a combination of a scan ID and a box ID. It is used in the Ergo Node API to provide a unique identifier for a box that has been scanned. 

The class has two private instance variables: `scanId` and `boxId`. `scanId` is an integer that represents the ID of the scan that the box was a part of, while `boxId` is a string that represents the ID of the box itself. 

The class provides getter and setter methods for both instance variables, as well as an `equals` method that compares two `ScanIdBoxId` objects for equality based on their `scanId` and `boxId` values. It also provides a `hashCode` method for generating a hash code based on the `scanId` and `boxId` values, and a `toString` method for generating a string representation of the object.

This class is used in other parts of the Ergo Node API to uniquely identify scanned boxes. For example, it may be used in a request to retrieve information about a specific box that has been scanned, or to update the status of a box that has been scanned. 

Example usage:

```
ScanIdBoxId scanIdBoxId = new ScanIdBoxId();
scanIdBoxId.setScanId(123);
scanIdBoxId.setBoxId("abc123");

System.out.println(scanIdBoxId.getScanId()); // Output: 123
System.out.println(scanIdBoxId.getBoxId()); // Output: abc123
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a Java class called `ScanIdBoxId` which has two properties: `scanId` and `boxId`.

2. What is the expected input and output of this code?
- The input is an integer `scanId` and a string `boxId`. The output is an instance of the `ScanIdBoxId` class with the `scanId` and `boxId` properties set.

3. Can the `scanId` and `boxId` properties be null?
- The `scanId` property cannot be null as it is marked as required in the `@Schema` annotation. The `boxId` property is not marked as required and can be null.
