The `StringUtil` class in the `ergo-appkit` project provides two utility methods for working with arrays of strings. 

The first method, `containsIgnoreCase`, takes an array of strings and a value to search for. It returns a boolean indicating whether the value is present in the array, using a case-insensitive comparison. If the value is null and there is a null element in the array, the method returns true. This method can be useful for checking if a particular string value is present in an array, regardless of case.

Here is an example usage of the `containsIgnoreCase` method:

```
String[] fruits = {"apple", "banana", "orange"};
boolean containsApple = StringUtil.containsIgnoreCase(fruits, "APPLE");
// containsApple is true
```

The second method, `join`, takes an array of strings and a separator string. It returns a single string that is the concatenation of all the elements in the array, separated by the given separator. This method can be useful for constructing a comma-separated list of values, for example.

Here is an example usage of the `join` method:

```
String[] names = {"Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"};
String commaSeparatedNames = StringUtil.join(names, ", ");
// commaSeparatedNames is "Alice, Bob, Charlie"
```

Overall, the `StringUtil` class provides simple but useful utility methods for working with arrays of strings. These methods can be used throughout the `ergo-appkit` project to simplify string manipulation tasks.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code provides utility methods for string manipulation, specifically for checking if an array contains a value (case-insensitive) and joining an array of strings with a separator.

2. Are there any external dependencies for this code?
- The code mentions that the `join` method might be replaced by a utility method from `commons-lang` or `guava` if either of those libraries is added as a dependency.

3. Can the methods in this code be modified?
- The code explicitly states that it is auto-generated by the Swagger code generator program and should not be edited manually. However, it is not clear if the methods themselves can be modified or overridden in a subclass.
