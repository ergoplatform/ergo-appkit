The `TokenInfo` class is a model class that represents information about a token asset in the Ergo Explorer API. It contains fields for the ID of the asset, the box ID it was issued by, the emission amount, name, description, type, and number of decimal places. 

This class is generated automatically by the Swagger Codegen program and should not be edited manually. It includes annotations for the OpenAPI specification version 1.0 and the Gson library for JSON serialization and deserialization. 

This class can be used in the larger project to represent token assets in the Ergo Explorer API. For example, it can be used to deserialize JSON responses from the API into Java objects that can be manipulated and displayed in the user interface. 

Here is an example of how this class can be used to deserialize a JSON response from the API:

```java
import com.google.gson.Gson;

// assume json is a String containing a JSON response from the API
String json = "{...}";

// create a Gson object to deserialize the JSON
Gson gson = new Gson();

// deserialize the JSON into a TokenInfo object
TokenInfo tokenInfo = gson.fromJson(json, TokenInfo.class);

// access the fields of the TokenInfo object
String id = tokenInfo.getId();
String name = tokenInfo.getName();
// etc.
```

Overall, the `TokenInfo` class is an important part of the Ergo Explorer API and can be used to represent token assets in the larger project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a Java class called `TokenInfo` which represents information about a token asset.

2. What are the required fields for a `TokenInfo` object?
- A `TokenInfo` object requires an `id` and a `boxId` field.

3. What is the purpose of the `emissionAmount` field?
- The `emissionAmount` field represents the number of decimal places for the token asset.
