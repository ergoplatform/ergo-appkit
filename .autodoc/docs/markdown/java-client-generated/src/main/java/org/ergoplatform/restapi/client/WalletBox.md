The `WalletBox` class is part of the Ergo Node API and is used to represent a box in a wallet. A box is a basic unit of storage in the Ergo blockchain and contains a certain amount of tokens and data. The `WalletBox` class contains information about the box, such as its address, creation and spending transactions, and the number of confirmations it has received.

The `WalletBox` class has several properties, including `box`, which is an instance of the `ErgoTransactionOutput` class and represents the output of a transaction that created the box. The `confirmationsNum` property is an integer that represents the number of confirmations the box has received. The `address` property is a string that represents the address of the box. The `creationTransaction` and `spendingTransaction` properties are strings that represent the IDs of the transactions that created and spent the box, respectively. The `spendingHeight` and `inclusionHeight` properties are integers that represent the heights of the blocks in which the spending and creation transactions were included, respectively. The `onchain` and `spent` properties are boolean values that indicate whether the box is on the main chain and whether it has been spent, respectively. The `creationOutIndex` property is an integer that represents the index of the output in the transaction that created the box. Finally, the `scans` property is a list of integers that represent the scan identifiers the box relates to.

The `WalletBox` class provides getters and setters for each of its properties, allowing developers to easily access and modify the information stored in the class. For example, to get the address of a `WalletBox` object, the `getAddress()` method can be called. To set the address of a `WalletBox` object, the `setAddress()` method can be called.

Overall, the `WalletBox` class is an important part of the Ergo Node API and is used to represent a box in a wallet. It provides a convenient way for developers to access and modify the information associated with a box.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `WalletBox` class?
- The `WalletBox` class is a model for a box in a wallet, containing information such as its transaction output, address, and spending status.

2. What is the significance of the `onchain` field?
- The `onchain` field is a boolean flag that indicates whether the box was created on the main chain.

3. What is the purpose of the `scans` field?
- The `scans` field is a list of scan identifiers that the box relates to. It is not clear from this code what a "scan" refers to, so further investigation may be necessary.
