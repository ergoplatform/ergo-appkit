The code defines a Java class called `BlacklistedPeers` which represents a list of IP addresses that have been blacklisted by the Ergo Node API. The purpose of this class is to provide a way for the Ergo Node API to keep track of IP addresses that have been identified as malicious or otherwise undesirable, and to prevent them from accessing the API in the future.

The `BlacklistedPeers` class has a single field called `addresses`, which is a list of strings representing the IP addresses that have been blacklisted. The class provides methods for adding and retrieving IP addresses from the list.

The class also includes methods for comparing instances of the class for equality and generating a string representation of the class.

This class is likely used in conjunction with other classes and methods in the Ergo Node API to provide security and access control features. For example, the API may use this class to check incoming requests against the list of blacklisted IP addresses and deny access to any requests coming from those addresses.

Example usage:

```
// create a new instance of the BlacklistedPeers class
BlacklistedPeers blacklistedPeers = new BlacklistedPeers();

// add an IP address to the list of blacklisted peers
blacklistedPeers.addAddressesItem("192.168.1.1");

// retrieve the list of blacklisted peers
List<String> addresses = blacklistedPeers.getAddresses();

// print out the list of blacklisted peers
System.out.println("Blacklisted peers: " + addresses);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines a Java class called `BlacklistedPeers` which has a list of IP addresses that are blacklisted.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
   - This code depends on the `com.google.gson` and `io.swagger.v3.oas.annotations` libraries.

3. Can the list of blacklisted addresses be modified after it is set?
   - Yes, the `addresses` field can be modified by calling the `setAddresses` method or the `addAddressesItem` method to add individual addresses to the list.
