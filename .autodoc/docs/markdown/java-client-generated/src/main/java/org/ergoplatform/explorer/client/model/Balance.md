This code defines a Java class called `Balance` that represents the balance of an Ergo wallet. The `Balance` class has two properties: `nanoErgs` and `tokens`. The `nanoErgs` property is a `Long` that represents the balance of the wallet in Ergs, the native currency of the Ergo blockchain. The `tokens` property is a list of `TokenAmount` objects that represent the balance of the wallet in non-native tokens.

The `Balance` class has getter and setter methods for both properties. The `getNanoErgs` method returns the value of the `nanoErgs` property, while the `getTokens` method returns the list of `TokenAmount` objects. The `setNanoErgs` and `setTokens` methods set the values of the `nanoErgs` and `tokens` properties, respectively. The `addTokensItem` method adds a `TokenAmount` object to the list of tokens.

The `Balance` class also has methods for equality checking, hashing, and string representation. These methods are used to compare `Balance` objects, generate hash codes for `Balance` objects, and convert `Balance` objects to strings, respectively.

This class is likely used in the larger project to represent the balance of an Ergo wallet. It can be instantiated with a balance in Ergs and a list of `TokenAmount` objects representing the balance in non-native tokens. The `Balance` object can then be passed around the project to represent the wallet balance. For example, it could be used to display the balance of a wallet in a user interface or to calculate the total value of a user's assets. 

Example usage:
```
Balance balance = new Balance();
balance.setNanoErgs(1000000000L); // set balance to 1 Erg
List<TokenAmount> tokens = new ArrayList<>();
tokens.add(new TokenAmount("Token1", 100)); // add 100 units of Token1
tokens.add(new TokenAmount("Token2", 50)); // add 50 units of Token2
balance.setTokens(tokens); // set the token balances
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a Java class called `Balance` that represents the balance of an Ergo wallet, including the amount of nanoErgs and any tokens held.

2. What is the significance of the `@Schema` annotation?
- The `@Schema` annotation is used to provide metadata about the `nanoErgs` and `tokens` fields, including their descriptions and whether they are required.

3. What is the purpose of the `toIndentedString` method?
- The `toIndentedString` method is a helper method used to convert an object to a string with each line indented by 4 spaces, which is used in the `toString` method to format the output of the `Balance` class.
