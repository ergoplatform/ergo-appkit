The `InputInfo` class is a model class that represents an input to a transaction in the Ergo blockchain. It contains various fields that provide information about the input, such as the ID of the corresponding box, the number of nanoErgs in the box, the index of the input in the transaction, and the hex-encoded serialized sigma proof. 

The class also contains fields that provide information about the output of the transaction that corresponds to the input, such as the modifier ID, the ID of the transaction outputting the corresponding box, and the index of the output corresponding to the input. Additionally, the class contains fields that provide information about the box holder, such as the decoded address of the corresponding box holder and the assets associated with the input.

This class is used in the larger Ergo Explorer API project to represent inputs to transactions in the Ergo blockchain. It can be used to deserialize JSON responses from the Ergo Explorer API into Java objects, and to serialize Java objects into JSON requests to the API. 

For example, to deserialize a JSON response from the Ergo Explorer API into an `InputInfo` object, the following code can be used:

```
Gson gson = new Gson();
InputInfo inputInfo = gson.fromJson(jsonString, InputInfo.class);
```

Where `jsonString` is the JSON response string. Similarly, to serialize an `InputInfo` object into a JSON request to the Ergo Explorer API, the following code can be used:

```
Gson gson = new Gson();
String jsonRequest = gson.toJson(inputInfo);
```

Where `inputInfo` is the `InputInfo` object to be serialized.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a Java class called `InputInfo` which represents input information for a transaction in the Ergo blockchain.

2. What are the required fields for an `InputInfo` object?
- The required fields are `boxId`, `value`, `index`, `outputBlockId`, `outputTransactionId`, `outputIndex`, `ergoTree`, `address`, and `additionalRegisters`.

3. What is the purpose of the `assets` field in an `InputInfo` object?
- The `assets` field is a list of `AssetInstanceInfo` objects representing the assets held in the corresponding box.
