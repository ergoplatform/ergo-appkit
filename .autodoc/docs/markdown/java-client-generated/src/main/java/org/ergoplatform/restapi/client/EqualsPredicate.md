The `EqualsPredicate` class is part of the Ergo Node API and is used to represent a scanning predicate for searching for a specific value in a register of a transaction. This class extends the `ScanningPredicate` class and adds two fields: `register` and `bytes`. The `register` field is a string that represents the name of the register to search in, while the `bytes` field is a string that represents the value to search for.

This class is generated automatically by the Swagger code generator program and should not be edited manually. It provides methods for setting and getting the values of the `register` and `bytes` fields, as well as methods for checking equality and generating a string representation of the object.

This class can be used in the larger Ergo Node API project to represent a scanning predicate for searching for a specific value in a register of a transaction. For example, the following code snippet shows how an `EqualsPredicate` object can be created and used to search for a specific value in a register:

```
EqualsPredicate predicate = new EqualsPredicate();
predicate.register("R4");
predicate.bytes("1234567890abcdef");

List<Transaction> transactions = nodeApi.searchTransactions(predicate);
```

In this example, an `EqualsPredicate` object is created with the `register` field set to "R4" and the `bytes` field set to "1234567890abcdef". This object is then passed to the `searchTransactions` method of the `nodeApi` object, which returns a list of transactions that match the predicate.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a model for an EqualsPredicate object used in the Ergo Node API.

2. What is the relationship between this code and other files in the ergo-appkit project?
- It is unclear from this code snippet what the relationship is between this code and other files in the ergo-appkit project.

3. What is the expected input and output of the methods in this code?
- The expected input and output of the methods in this code are not explicitly stated, but can be inferred from the code comments and annotations. For example, the `getBytes()` method is annotated with `@Schema(required = true, description = "")`, indicating that it expects a non-null input and returns a String.
