The `ExplorerApiClient` class is a wrapper around the Retrofit library that provides a convenient way to interact with a RESTful API. It is designed to be used in the Ergo AppKit project. 

The class has several methods that allow the user to configure the Retrofit instance, such as `createDefaultAdapter()`, which sets up the default configuration for the Retrofit instance, and `createService()`, which creates a service interface for the API. 

The `setDateFormat()`, `setSqlDateFormat()`, `setOffsetDateTimeFormat()`, and `setLocalDateFormat()` methods allow the user to set the date format for the JSON responses. 

The `configureFromOkclient()` and `configureFromOkClientBuilder()` methods allow the user to configure the Retrofit instance using an existing `OkHttpClient` instance or builder. 

The `GsonCustomConverterFactory` class is a custom converter factory that extends the `Converter.Factory` class. It is used to handle the case where the deserialization fails due to a `JsonParseException` and the expected type is `String`. In this case, the `GsonResponseBodyConverterToString` class is used to return the body string. 

Overall, the `ExplorerApiClient` class provides a convenient way to interact with a RESTful API using the Retrofit library. It is designed to be used in the Ergo AppKit project and provides several methods to configure the Retrofit instance. The `GsonCustomConverterFactory` class is a custom converter factory that handles the case where the deserialization fails due to a `JsonParseException` and the expected type is `String`.
