The `BoxQuery` class is a model class that represents a query for a box in the Ergo blockchain. A box is a data structure that contains assets and registers, and is used to store and transfer value in the blockchain. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to search for boxes that meet certain criteria.

The class has four fields: `ergoTreeTemplateHash`, `registers`, `constants`, and `assets`. The `ergoTreeTemplateHash` field is a SHA-256 hash of the ErgoTree template that the box script should have. The `registers` field is a map of register IDs and register values that the box should contain. The `constants` field is a map of constant indices and constant values that the box should contain. The `assets` field is a list of token IDs that the box should contain.

The class provides methods to set and get the values of these fields. For example, the `ergoTreeTemplateHash` field can be set using the `ergoTreeTemplateHash` method, and retrieved using the `getErgoTreeTemplateHash` method. Similarly, the `registers` field can be set using the `registers` method, and retrieved using the `getRegisters` method.

This class is used in the larger Ergo Explorer API project to search for boxes that meet certain criteria. For example, a user might want to search for boxes that contain a certain token, or that have a certain register value. The `BoxQuery` class provides a way to specify these criteria in a structured way, and to pass them to the API for processing. 

Example usage:

```
BoxQuery query = new BoxQuery()
    .ergoTreeTemplateHash("1234567890abcdef")
    .putRegistersItem("R1", "hello")
    .addAssetsItem("token1")
    .addAssetsItem("token2");
```

This creates a `BoxQuery` object with an ErgoTree template hash of "1234567890abcdef", a register value of "hello" for register R1, and two token IDs ("token1" and "token2").
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `BoxQuery` class?
- The `BoxQuery` class is a model class that represents a query for a box in the Ergo blockchain.

2. What are the different properties of a `BoxQuery` object?
- A `BoxQuery` object has four properties: `ergoTreeTemplateHash`, `registers`, `constants`, and `assets`.

3. What is the format of the `ergoTreeTemplateHash` property?
- The `ergoTreeTemplateHash` property is a SHA-256 hash of the ErgoTree template that the box script should have.
