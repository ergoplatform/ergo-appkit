This code defines a Java class called `FullBlockInfo` that represents a full block in the Ergo blockchain. The class has four instance variables: `header`, `blockTransactions`, `extension`, and `adProofs`. 

The `header` variable is an instance of the `HeaderInfo` class, which contains information about the block header. The `blockTransactions` variable is a list of `TransactionInfo1` objects, which represent the transactions in the block. The `extension` variable is an instance of the `BlockExtensionInfo` class, which contains additional information about the block. The `adProofs` variable is a string that contains serialized hex-encoded AD Proofs.

The class provides getter and setter methods for each instance variable, as well as methods to add a `TransactionInfo1` object to the `blockTransactions` list and to convert the object to a string.

This class is likely used in the larger Ergo appkit project to represent full blocks in the Ergo blockchain. It can be used to retrieve information about a block's header, transactions, and extension, as well as its AD Proofs. For example, a developer could use this class to retrieve the header of the most recent block in the blockchain:

```
FullBlockInfo block = // retrieve the most recent block
HeaderInfo header = block.getHeader();
```

Overall, this code provides a convenient way to represent and manipulate full blocks in the Ergo blockchain.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a Java class called `FullBlockInfo` which represents a full block information in the Ergo Explorer API.

2. What are the properties of the `FullBlockInfo` class?
- The `FullBlockInfo` class has four properties: `header` of type `HeaderInfo`, `blockTransactions` of type `List<TransactionInfo1>`, `extension` of type `BlockExtensionInfo`, and `adProofs` of type `String`.

3. What is the purpose of the `adProofs` property?
- The `adProofs` property is a serialized hex-encoded AD Proofs, which is a cryptographic proof that a transaction was included in a block.
