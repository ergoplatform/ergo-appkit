The `ApiError` class is a model class that represents an error response from the Ergo Node API. It contains three fields: `error`, `reason`, and `detail`. The `error` field is an integer that represents the error code, while the `reason` field is a string that represents the error message. The `detail` field is a string that provides a more detailed description of the error.

This class is generated automatically by the Swagger Codegen program and should not be edited manually. It is used by the Ergo Node API to provide error responses to clients. When an error occurs, the API will return an instance of the `ApiError` class with the appropriate error code, error message, and detailed description.

Here is an example of how this class might be used in the larger project:

```java
try {
    // make API request
} catch (ApiException e) {
    // handle error response
    ApiError error = e.getResponseBody();
    System.out.println("Error code: " + error.getError());
    System.out.println("Error message: " + error.getReason());
    System.out.println("Error details: " + error.getDetail());
}
```

In this example, an API request is made and an `ApiException` is thrown if an error occurs. The `getResponseBody()` method is called to retrieve the error response as an instance of the `ApiError` class. The error code, error message, and detailed description are then printed to the console for debugging purposes.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a Java class called `ApiError` that represents an error response from an API.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on the `com.google.gson` and `io.swagger.v3.oas.annotations` libraries.

3. Can the properties of `ApiError` be null?
- No, the `error`, `reason`, and `detail` properties of `ApiError` are all marked as required in the OpenAPI schema annotations.
