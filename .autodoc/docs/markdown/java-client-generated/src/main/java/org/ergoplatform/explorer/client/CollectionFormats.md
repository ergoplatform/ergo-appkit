The `CollectionFormats` class in the `ergo-appkit` project provides a set of classes for formatting collections of strings into various formats. These formats include CSV, SSV, TSV, and PIPES. 

The `CSVParams`, `SSVParams`, `TSVParams`, and `PIPESParams` classes are all subclasses of the `CollectionFormats` class. Each of these subclasses has a `toString()` method that formats the list of strings into the corresponding format. 

The `CSVParams` class formats the list of strings into a comma-separated value format. The `SSVParams` class formats the list of strings into a space-separated value format. The `TSVParams` class formats the list of strings into a tab-separated value format. The `PIPESParams` class formats the list of strings into a pipe-separated value format. 

Each of these subclasses has three constructors: a default constructor, a constructor that takes a list of strings, and a constructor that takes a variable number of string arguments. The `getParams()` and `setParams()` methods are used to get and set the list of strings that will be formatted. 

This code can be used in the larger project to format collections of strings into various formats for use in different parts of the application. For example, if the application needs to output data in a CSV format, the `CSVParams` class can be used to format the data. Similarly, if the application needs to output data in a different format, such as a space-separated value format, the `SSVParams` class can be used. 

Here is an example of how the `CSVParams` class can be used to format a list of strings:

```
List<String> params = Arrays.asList("param1", "param2", "param3");
CSVParams csvParams = new CSVParams(params);
String formattedParams = csvParams.toString();
```

In this example, a list of strings is created and passed to the `CSVParams` constructor. The `toString()` method is then called on the `csvParams` object to format the list of strings into a CSV format. The resulting string, `formattedParams`, can then be used in the application as needed.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `CollectionFormats` class?
    
    `CollectionFormats` is a class that contains several nested classes that define different formats for collections of strings.

2. What are the differences between the `CSVParams`, `SSVParams`, `TSVParams`, and `PIPESParams` classes?
    
    Each of these classes extends the `CSVParams` class and overrides the `toString()` method to define a different delimiter for joining the list of strings. `SSVParams` uses a space delimiter, `TSVParams` uses a tab delimiter, and `PIPESParams` uses a pipe delimiter.

3. What is the purpose of the `StringUtil` class?
    
    The `StringUtil` class is not included in this code snippet, so a smart developer might wonder what it does and where it is defined. It is likely a utility class that provides string manipulation methods, such as `join()`, which is used in the `toString()` methods of the nested classes to join the list of strings with a delimiter.
