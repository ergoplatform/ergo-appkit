The `CollectionFormats` class in the `org.ergoplatform.restapi.client` package provides a set of classes for formatting collections of parameters into different string formats. The purpose of this code is to provide a convenient way to format collections of parameters for use in REST API requests.

The `CSVParams` class represents a collection of parameters separated by commas. It has three constructors: one that takes no arguments, one that takes a `List` of `String` parameters, and one that takes a variable number of `String` parameters. It also has a `toString()` method that joins the parameters into a comma-separated string.

The `SSVParams` class extends `CSVParams` and represents a collection of parameters separated by spaces. It has the same constructors as `CSVParams`, but overrides the `toString()` method to join the parameters into a space-separated string.

The `TSVParams` class extends `CSVParams` and represents a collection of parameters separated by tabs. It has the same constructors as `CSVParams`, but overrides the `toString()` method to join the parameters into a tab-separated string.

The `PIPESParams` class extends `CSVParams` and represents a collection of parameters separated by pipes. It has the same constructors as `CSVParams`, but overrides the `toString()` method to join the parameters into a pipe-separated string.

These classes can be used in the larger project to format collections of parameters for use in REST API requests. For example, if a REST API requires a comma-separated list of parameters, an instance of `CSVParams` can be created and passed as a parameter in the API request. Similarly, if a REST API requires a space-separated list of parameters, an instance of `SSVParams` can be created and passed as a parameter in the API request. By providing these different formatting options, the `CollectionFormats` class makes it easier to work with REST APIs that have different requirements for parameter formatting.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `CollectionFormats` class?
    
    `CollectionFormats` is a class that defines several nested classes that represent different formats for collections of parameters.

2. What are the differences between the `CSVParams`, `SSVParams`, `TSVParams`, and `PIPESParams` classes?
    
    Each of these classes extends `CSVParams` and overrides the `toString()` method to join the list of parameters with a different delimiter (comma, space, tab, or pipe).

3. What is the purpose of the `StringUtil` class?
    
    The `StringUtil` class is not shown in this code, but it is likely used to provide a utility method for joining an array of strings with a delimiter.
