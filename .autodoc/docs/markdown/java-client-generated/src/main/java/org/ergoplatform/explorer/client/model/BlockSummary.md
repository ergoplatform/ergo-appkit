This code defines a Java class called `BlockSummary` that represents a summary of a block in the Ergo blockchain. The class has two properties: `block` and `references`, both of which are objects of other classes (`FullBlockInfo` and `BlockReferencesInfo`, respectively). 

The `FullBlockInfo` class represents detailed information about a block, while the `BlockReferencesInfo` class represents information about the block's references to other blocks in the blockchain. 

The `BlockSummary` class provides getter and setter methods for both properties, allowing other parts of the code to access and modify them. The class also overrides the `equals`, `hashCode`, and `toString` methods for proper comparison and string representation of `BlockSummary` objects.

This class is likely used in the larger Ergo Explorer API project to provide a high-level summary of a block's information, including its references to other blocks. Other parts of the project can use this class to easily access and manipulate this information. For example, a method in another class might take a `BlockSummary` object as a parameter and use its `getBlock()` method to access the detailed information about the block. 

Here is an example of how this class might be used in another part of the project:

```
public void printBlockSummary(BlockSummary blockSummary) {
    System.out.println("Block summary:");
    System.out.println("Block info: " + blockSummary.getBlock());
    System.out.println("References: " + blockSummary.getReferences());
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a Java class called `BlockSummary` that contains a `FullBlockInfo` object and a `BlockReferencesInfo` object.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code uses the `com.google.gson` and `io.swagger.v3.oas.annotations` libraries.

3. What is the expected input and output of this code?
- This code does not have any input or output, as it only defines a Java class. However, the `BlockSummary` class can be used as a data model for other parts of the `ergo-appkit` project that deal with blocks and their references.
