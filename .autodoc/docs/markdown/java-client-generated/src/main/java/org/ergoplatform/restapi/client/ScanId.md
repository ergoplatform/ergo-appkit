The code represents a Java class called `ScanId` which is a part of the Ergo Node API. The purpose of this class is to model a scan ID which is used to identify a specific scan in the Ergo blockchain. The class has a single field called `scanId` which is an integer representing the ID of the scan. 

The class provides a getter and a setter method for the `scanId` field. The `getScanId()` method returns the value of the `scanId` field, while the `setScanId()` method sets the value of the `scanId` field. 

The class also provides methods for equality checking, hashing, and string representation. The `equals()` method checks if two `ScanId` objects are equal by comparing their `scanId` fields. The `hashCode()` method returns a hash code value for the `ScanId` object based on its `scanId` field. The `toString()` method returns a string representation of the `ScanId` object, including its `scanId` field.

This class can be used in the larger Ergo Node API project to represent a scan ID in various API requests and responses. For example, a request to get information about a specific scan may include a `ScanId` object as a parameter, while a response from the API may include a `ScanId` object as a field in a JSON object. 

Here is an example of how this class can be used:

```
ScanId scanId = new ScanId();
scanId.setScanId(12345);
int id = scanId.getScanId();
System.out.println("Scan ID: " + id);
```

This code creates a new `ScanId` object, sets its `scanId` field to 12345, gets the value of the `scanId` field using the `getScanId()` method, and prints it to the console. The output will be "Scan ID: 12345".
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a Java class for a model called ScanId in the Ergo Node API.

2. What is the significance of the @SerializedName and @Schema annotations?
- The @SerializedName annotation is used to specify the name of the JSON property that corresponds to the Java field. The @Schema annotation is used to provide additional information about the field for documentation purposes.

3. Why is the toString() method overridden in this class?
- The toString() method is overridden to provide a string representation of the ScanId object for debugging and logging purposes.
