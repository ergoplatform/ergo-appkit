The `DhtSecret` class is a model class that represents a Diffie-Hellman tuple consisting of a secret exponent `w`, along with generators `g` and `h`, and group elements `u` and `v`. The purpose of this class is to provide a standardized way of representing this tuple in the Ergo Node API. 

The class contains five private fields, each of which represents one of the tuple elements. These fields are annotated with `@SerializedName` and `@Schema` annotations, which provide metadata about the fields. The `@SerializedName` annotation specifies the name of the field in the serialized JSON representation of the object, while the `@Schema` annotation provides a description of the field, an example value, and whether the field is required or not.

The class also contains getter and setter methods for each field, which allow the fields to be accessed and modified. Additionally, the class contains methods for equality checking, hashing, and string representation.

This class can be used in the larger Ergo Node API project to represent Diffie-Hellman tuples in various API endpoints. For example, it could be used in an endpoint that generates a new DHT secret, or in an endpoint that retrieves an existing DHT secret. 

Here is an example of how this class could be used to create a new DHT secret:

```
DhtSecret secret = new DhtSecret()
    .secret("433080ff80d0d52d7f8bfffff47f00807f44f680000949b800007f7f7ff1017f")
    .g("02a7955281885bf0f0ca4a48678848cad8dc5b328ce8bc1d4481d041c98e891ff3")
    .h("02a7955281885bf0f0ca4a48678848cad8dc5b328ce8bc1d4481d041c98e891ff3")
    .u("02a7955281885bf0f0ca4a48678848cad8dc5b328ce8bc1d4481d041c98e891ff3")
    .v("02a7955281885bf0f0ca4a48678848cad8dc5b328ce8bc1d4481d041c98e891ff3");
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a Java class called `DhtSecret` which represents a Diffie-Hellman tuple with secret exponent and generators.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on the `com.google.gson` and `io.swagger.v3.oas.annotations` libraries.

3. Can the properties of this class be null?
- No, all properties of this class (`secret`, `g`, `h`, `u`, and `v`) are marked as required in the OpenAPI schema annotations.
