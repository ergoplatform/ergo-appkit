The `CandidateBlock` class is part of the Ergo Node API and is used to represent a candidate block that is being mined by a node. It contains information about the block such as its version, timestamp, state root, and number of transactions. 

The class has several methods that allow for setting and getting the values of its fields. For example, the `version` method sets the version of the candidate block, while the `getTransactionsNumber` method returns the number of transactions in the block. 

The class also has methods for converting the object to a string and for checking if two objects are equal. These methods are used for debugging and testing purposes. 

Overall, the `CandidateBlock` class is an important part of the Ergo Node API as it allows developers to interact with candidate blocks that are being mined by nodes. It can be used in conjunction with other classes in the API to build applications that interact with the Ergo blockchain. 

Example usage:

```java
CandidateBlock block = new CandidateBlock();
block.setVersion(2);
block.setTimestamp(1631234567);
block.setParentId("1234567890abcdef");
block.setTransactionsNumber(10);

System.out.println(block.getVersion()); // Output: 2
System.out.println(block.getTimestamp()); // Output: 1631234567
System.out.println(block.getParentId()); // Output: 1234567890abcdef
System.out.println(block.getTransactionsNumber()); // Output: 10
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a model for a candidate block in the Ergo Node API, which can be null if the node is not mining or the candidate block is not ready.

2. What is the significance of the Transactions class?
- The Transactions class is a property of the CandidateBlock class and represents the transactions included in the candidate block.

3. Can the values of any of the properties be null?
- Yes, the values of some properties can be null, such as timestamp, stateRoot, adProofBytes, and votes.
