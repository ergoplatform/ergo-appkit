The `AvlTreeData` class is part of the Ergo Node API and is used to represent AVL tree data. The class contains four properties: `digest`, `treeFlags`, `keyLength`, and `valueLength`. 

The `digest` property is a string that represents the hash of the AVL tree. The `treeFlags` property is an integer that represents the flags of the AVL tree. The `keyLength` property is an integer that represents the length of the key in the AVL tree. The `valueLength` property is an integer that represents the length of the value in the AVL tree.

The class provides getters and setters for each property. The `toString()` method is overridden to provide a string representation of the object. The `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods are also overridden to provide a way to compare objects of this class.

This class is used in the larger Ergo Node API project to represent AVL tree data. It can be used to create and manipulate AVL trees. For example, the following code creates an `AvlTreeData` object with a digest of "abc123", tree flags of 1, key length of 10, and value length of 20:

```
AvlTreeData avlTreeData = new AvlTreeData()
    .digest("abc123")
    .treeFlags(1)
    .keyLength(10)
    .valueLength(20);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `AvlTreeData` class?
- The `AvlTreeData` class is part of the Ergo Node API and represents data related to an AVL tree.

2. What are the required fields for an `AvlTreeData` object?
- The `digest` field is the only required field for an `AvlTreeData` object.

3. Can the `treeFlags`, `keyLength`, and `valueLength` fields be null?
- Yes, the `treeFlags`, `keyLength`, and `valueLength` fields can be null.
