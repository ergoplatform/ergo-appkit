The `ContainsPredicate` class is part of the Ergo Node API and is used to represent a scanning predicate that checks if a given register contains a specific byte sequence. This class extends the `ScanningPredicate` class, which provides additional functionality for scanning Ergo transactions.

The `ContainsPredicate` class has two properties: `register` and `bytes`. The `register` property is a string that specifies the register to scan, while the `bytes` property is a required string that specifies the byte sequence to search for.

This class provides methods to set and get the values of these properties. The `register` property can be set using the `register()` method, while the `bytes` property can be set using the `bytes()` method. Both methods return the `ContainsPredicate` object, which allows for method chaining.

The `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` methods are also implemented in this class. These methods are used to compare two `ContainsPredicate` objects for equality, generate a hash code for the object, and convert the object to a string representation, respectively.

Overall, the `ContainsPredicate` class is a useful tool for scanning Ergo transactions for specific byte sequences in a given register. It can be used in conjunction with other scanning predicates to create complex scanning rules for Ergo transactions. Here is an example of how this class can be used:

```
ContainsPredicate predicate = new ContainsPredicate();
predicate.register("R4");
predicate.bytes("0x1234567890abcdef");
``` 

This code creates a new `ContainsPredicate` object and sets the `register` property to "R4" and the `bytes` property to "0x1234567890abcdef". This predicate can then be used to scan Ergo transactions for the specified byte sequence in the "R4" register.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a Java class for a ContainsPredicate object used in the Ergo Node API. It extends the ScanningPredicate class and contains two properties: register and bytes.

2. What is the significance of the ScanningPredicate class?
- The ScanningPredicate class is a parent class of ContainsPredicate and likely contains shared properties and methods that are relevant to all scanning predicates used in the Ergo Node API.

3. What is the expected format of the "bytes" property?
- The "bytes" property is marked as required and is a string type, but without additional context it is unclear what format the string should be in.
