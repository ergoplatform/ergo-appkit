The `WalletApi` interface in the `org.ergoplatform.restapi.client` package is part of the Ergo Appkit project and provides a set of API methods to interact with the Ergo wallet. These methods allow developers to perform various wallet-related operations such as creating, restoring, locking, and unlocking wallets, managing wallet addresses and keys, and handling wallet transactions.

Some key methods in the `WalletApi` interface include:

- `addBox(ScanIdsBox body)`: Adds a box to scans and writes it to the database if it's not already there.
- `checkSeed(Body2 body)`: Checks if the mnemonic phrase corresponds to the wallet seed.
- `getWalletStatus()`: Retrieves the wallet status.
- `walletAddresses()`: Gets wallet addresses.
- `walletBalances()`: Gets the total amount of confirmed Ergo tokens and assets.
- `walletBoxes(Integer minConfirmations, Integer minInclusionHeight)`: Gets a list of all wallet-related boxes, both spent and unspent.
- `walletInit(Body body)`: Initializes a new wallet with a randomly generated seed.
- `walletRestore(Body1 body)`: Creates a new wallet from an existing mnemonic seed.
- `walletLock()`: Locks the wallet.
- `walletUnlock(Body3 body)`: Unlocks the wallet.
- `walletTransactionGenerate(RequestsHolder body)`: Generates an arbitrary transaction from an array of requests.
- `walletTransactionSign(TransactionSigningRequest body)`: Signs an arbitrary unsigned transaction with wallet secrets and provided secrets.

These methods can be used in the larger project to manage and interact with Ergo wallets, enabling developers to build applications that require wallet functionality. For example, a developer could use the `walletInit()` method to create a new wallet, then use the `walletAddresses()` method to retrieve the wallet's addresses, and finally use the `walletTransactionGenerate()` method to create a new transaction.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `WalletApi` interface?
   **Answer:** The `WalletApi` interface defines the methods for interacting with the wallet-related REST API endpoints, such as adding a box to scans, checking the wallet seed, extracting hints from a transaction, and managing wallet transactions.

2. **Question:** What are the different types of request bodies used in the `WalletApi` interface?
   **Answer:** The `WalletApi` interface uses various request bodies such as `ScanIdsBox`, `Body`, `Body1`, `Body2`, `Body3`, `Body4`, `Body5`, `HintExtractionRequest`, `GenerateCommitmentsRequest`, `PaymentRequest`, `RequestsHolder`, `TransactionSigningRequest`, and `BoxesRequestHolder`.

3. **Question:** How are the API methods in the `WalletApi` interface annotated to specify the HTTP method and headers?
   **Answer:** The API methods in the `WalletApi` interface are annotated using Retrofit2 annotations such as `@GET`, `@POST`, `@Headers`, `@retrofit2.http.Query`, and `@retrofit2.http.Body` to specify the HTTP method, headers, and other request parameters.
