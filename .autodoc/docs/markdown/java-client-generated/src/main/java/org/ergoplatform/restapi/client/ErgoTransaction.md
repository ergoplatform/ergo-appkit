The `ErgoTransaction` class is a model class that represents an Ergo transaction. It contains information about the transaction's inputs, data inputs, outputs, and size in bytes. This class is generated automatically by the Swagger code generator program and should not be edited manually.

The `ErgoTransaction` class can be used in the larger project to represent Ergo transactions in a standardized way. For example, it can be used to deserialize JSON responses from the Ergo Node API into Java objects. Here is an example of how this class can be used:

```java
import org.ergoplatform.restapi.client.ErgoTransaction;
import com.google.gson.Gson;

// Assume that we have a JSON response from the Ergo Node API
String jsonResponse = "{\"id\":\"123\",\"inputs\":[],\"dataInputs\":[],\"outputs\":[],\"size\":100}";

// Deserialize the JSON response into an ErgoTransaction object
Gson gson = new Gson();
ErgoTransaction transaction = gson.fromJson(jsonResponse, ErgoTransaction.class);

// Access the properties of the ErgoTransaction object
String id = transaction.getId();
List<ErgoTransactionInput> inputs = transaction.getInputs();
List<ErgoTransactionDataInput> dataInputs = transaction.getDataInputs();
List<ErgoTransactionOutput> outputs = transaction.getOutputs();
Integer size = transaction.getSize();
```

In this example, we first assume that we have a JSON response from the Ergo Node API. We then use the Gson library to deserialize the JSON response into an `ErgoTransaction` object. Finally, we access the properties of the `ErgoTransaction` object to get information about the transaction.

Overall, the `ErgoTransaction` class is an important part of the Ergo Node API client library and can be used to represent Ergo transactions in a standardized way.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a Java class called `ErgoTransaction` which represents an Ergo transaction and contains information about its inputs, data inputs, outputs, and size.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on the `com.google.gson` and `io.swagger.v3.oas.annotations` libraries.

3. Can the properties of an `ErgoTransaction` object be modified after it is created?
- Yes, the properties of an `ErgoTransaction` object can be modified using the setter methods provided in the class.
