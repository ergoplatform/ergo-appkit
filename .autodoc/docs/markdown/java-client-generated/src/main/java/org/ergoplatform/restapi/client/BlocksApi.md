The `BlocksApi` interface is part of the `ergo-appkit` project and provides methods for interacting with the Ergo blockchain. This interface defines several HTTP methods that can be used to retrieve information about blocks, headers, transactions, and more.

The `getBlockHeaderById` method retrieves the header information for a given block ID. The `getBlockTransactionsById` method retrieves the transaction information for a given block ID. The `getChainSlice` method retrieves a list of block headers within a specified range of heights. The `getFullBlockAt` method retrieves the header IDs at a given height. The `getFullBlockById` method retrieves the full block information for a given block ID. The `getHeaderIds` method retrieves an array of header IDs. The `getLastHeaders` method retrieves the last headers objects. The `getModifierById` method retrieves the persistent modifier by its ID. The `getProofForTx` method retrieves the Merkle proof for a given transaction ID. The `sendMinedBlock` method sends a mined block to the Ergo network.

Each method takes in parameters that are used to construct the appropriate HTTP request. For example, the `getBlockHeaderById` method takes in a `headerId` parameter that is used to construct the URL for the HTTP GET request. The response from each method is wrapped in a `Call` object, which can be used to execute the request asynchronously.

Here is an example of how to use the `getBlockHeaderById` method:

```java
BlocksApi blocksApi = retrofit.create(BlocksApi.class);
Call<BlockHeader> call = blocksApi.getBlockHeaderById("blockId");
call.enqueue(new Callback<BlockHeader>() {
    @Override
    public void onResponse(Call<BlockHeader> call, Response<BlockHeader> response) {
        if (response.isSuccessful()) {
            BlockHeader blockHeader = response.body();
            // Do something with the block header
        } else {
            ApiError error = ApiErrorUtils.parseError(response);
            // Handle the error
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void onFailure(Call<BlockHeader> call, Throwable t) {
        // Handle the failure
    }
});
```

In this example, we create an instance of the `BlocksApi` interface using Retrofit. We then call the `getBlockHeaderById` method with a block ID parameter and enqueue the request to execute it asynchronously. When the response is received, we check if it was successful and handle the response or error accordingly.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines an interface for making REST API calls related to blocks in the Ergo blockchain.

2. What dependencies are required to use this code?
- This code requires the Retrofit2 library and its dependencies.

3. What API calls can be made using this interface?
- This interface allows for making API calls to get block header and transaction information, headers in a specified range, header IDs, last headers, persistent modifiers, and Merkle proofs for transactions. It also allows for sending a mined block.
