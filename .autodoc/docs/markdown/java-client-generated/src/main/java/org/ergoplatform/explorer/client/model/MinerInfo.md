This code defines a Java class called `MinerInfo` which represents information about a miner in the Ergo blockchain network. The class has two properties: `address` and `name`, both of which are strings. The `address` property represents the miner's reward address, while the `name` property represents the miner's name.

The class has two methods for setting the values of these properties: `address()` and `name()`. Both methods return an instance of the `MinerInfo` class, which allows for method chaining. For example, the following code sets the `address` and `name` properties of a `MinerInfo` object in a single statement:

```
MinerInfo miner = new MinerInfo()
    .address("abc123")
    .name("John Doe");
```

The class also has getter and setter methods for each property. The getter methods are annotated with `@Schema` to indicate that they are required properties.

The class overrides the `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` methods to provide basic object comparison and string representation functionality.

This class is likely used in the larger Ergo Explorer API project to represent miner information in various contexts, such as in responses to API requests or in database records. Other classes in the project may use instances of `MinerInfo` to store or manipulate miner information.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a Java class called `MinerInfo` that represents information about a miner, including their reward address and name.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code uses the `com.google.gson` and `io.swagger.v3.oas.annotations` libraries.

3. Can the `address` and `name` fields be null?
- No, both `address` and `name` fields are marked as required in the Swagger/OpenAPI annotations, so they cannot be null.
