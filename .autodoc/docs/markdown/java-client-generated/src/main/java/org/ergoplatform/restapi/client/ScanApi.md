The `ScanApi` interface defines methods for interacting with the Ergo blockchain through the Ergo Appkit. The methods in this interface allow for registering and deregistering scans, adding boxes to scans, and listing unspent boxes for a given scan. 

The `addBox` method adds a box to a scan and writes it to the database if it is not already there. The `deregisterScan` method stops tracking and deregisters a scan. The `listAllScans` method lists all registered scans. The `listUnspentScans` method lists boxes that are not spent for a given scan, with optional parameters for minimum confirmations and inclusion height. The `registerScan` method registers a new scan. Finally, the `scanStopTracking` method stops tracking a box related to a scan.

These methods can be used to build applications that interact with the Ergo blockchain. For example, an application that needs to track unspent boxes for a specific scan can use the `listUnspentScans` method to retrieve the necessary information. Similarly, an application that needs to add a box to a scan can use the `addBox` method to accomplish this. 

Here is an example of how the `listUnspentScans` method can be used:

```java
ScanApi scanApi = retrofit.create(ScanApi.class);
Call<List<WalletBox>> call = scanApi.listUnspentScans(scanId, minConfirmations, minInclusionHeight);
Response<List<WalletBox>> response = call.execute();
List<WalletBox> unspentBoxes = response.body();
```

In this example, `scanId` is the identifier of the scan for which unspent boxes should be retrieved, `minConfirmations` is the minimum number of confirmations required for a box to be considered unspent (default is 0), and `minInclusionHeight` is the minimum inclusion height required for a box to be considered unspent (default is 0). The `execute` method is called on the `Call` object to make the API request, and the resulting `List` of `WalletBox` objects is retrieved from the response body.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines an interface for making API calls related to scanning and tracking boxes in the Ergo blockchain.

2. What are the required parameters for the `addBox` method?
- The `addBox` method requires a `ScanIdsBox` object to be passed in the request body.

3. What is the response type for the `listAllScans` method?
- The `listAllScans` method returns a `Call` object that wraps a list of `Scan` objects.
