The `NodeInfo` class in the `ergo-appkit` project represents the information about an Ergo node. This information includes details such as the node's name, app version, network type, current state, and various block-related data. The class is auto-generated by the Swagger code generator from the Ergo Node API specification.

The `NodeInfo` class contains several fields, such as `name`, `appVersion`, `fullHeight`, `headersHeight`, `bestFullHeaderId`, `previousFullHeaderId`, `bestHeaderId`, `stateRoot`, `stateType`, `stateVersion`, `isMining`, `peersCount`, `unconfirmedCount`, `difficulty`, `currentTime`, `launchTime`, `headersScore`, `fullBlocksScore`, `genesisBlockId`, `restApiUrl`, and `parameters`. These fields store various information about the node, such as its name, version, current height of the full and header chain, best header and full header IDs, state root, state type and version, mining status, number of connected peers, unconfirmed transaction count, difficulty, current and launch time, header and full block scores, genesis block ID, REST API URL, and node parameters.

The `StateTypeEnum` enum is used to represent the state type of the node, which can be either "digest" or "utxo". The `Adapter` class within `StateTypeEnum` is used to convert the state type between its string representation and the enum value.

The `NodeInfo` class provides getter and setter methods for each field, as well as `equals`, `hashCode`, and `toString` methods for object comparison and representation. This class can be used in the larger project to interact with the Ergo Node API and retrieve or update information about the node.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `NodeInfo` class?**

   The `NodeInfo` class represents information about a node in the Ergo network. It contains various properties such as the node's name, app version, height, header information, state, mining status, and other related data.

2. **What is the `StateTypeEnum` enum used for?**

   The `StateTypeEnum` enum is used to represent the type of state the node is in. It has two possible values: `DIGEST` and `UTXO`, which represent the digest state and the unspent transaction output (UTXO) state, respectively.

3. **How is the `network` property used in the `NodeInfo` class?**

   The `network` property is used to store the type of network the node is connected to. It can have values like "mainnet", "testnet", or "devnet", representing the main network, test network, or development network, respectively.
