The `ApiKeyAuth` class is responsible for adding an API key to HTTP requests made by the Ergo Explorer client. It implements the `Interceptor` interface from the OkHttp library, which allows it to intercept and modify HTTP requests and responses.

The class takes two parameters in its constructor: `location` and `paramName`. `location` specifies where the API key should be added - either as a query parameter or a header. `paramName` specifies the name of the query parameter or header that should contain the API key.

The API key itself is stored in the `apiKey` field, which can be set using the `setApiKey` method. The `getApiKey` method can be used to retrieve the current API key.

The `intercept` method is where the actual interception and modification of requests happens. It first retrieves the original request using the `chain.request()` method. If the `location` is set to "query", it adds the API key as a query parameter to the request URL. If the `location` is set to "header", it adds the API key as a header to the request.

The modified request is then returned using `chain.proceed(request)`, which sends the request to the server and returns the server's response.

This class can be used in the larger Ergo Explorer project to ensure that all requests made by the client include the necessary API key. For example, if the Ergo Explorer client needs to make a request to the Ergo blockchain API, it can use an instance of `ApiKeyAuth` to add the API key to the request. Here's an example of how this might be done:

```
ApiKeyAuth apiKeyAuth = new ApiKeyAuth("header", "X-Api-Key");
apiKeyAuth.setApiKey("my-api-key");

OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient.Builder()
        .addInterceptor(apiKeyAuth)
        .build();

Request request = new Request.Builder()
        .url("https://api.ergoplatform.com")
        .build();

Response response = client.newCall(request).execute();
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code defines a class called `ApiKeyAuth` that implements the `Interceptor` interface from the OkHttp library. It is used to add an API key to HTTP requests either as a query parameter or a header.

2. What parameters does the `ApiKeyAuth` constructor take?
    
    The `ApiKeyAuth` constructor takes two parameters: `location` and `paramName`. `location` specifies whether the API key should be added as a query parameter or a header, and `paramName` is the name of the query parameter or header that the API key should be added to.

3. What does the `intercept` method do?
    
    The `intercept` method is called by OkHttp when an HTTP request is made. It checks the `location` parameter to determine whether the API key should be added as a query parameter or a header, and then modifies the request accordingly. If the `location` is "query", it adds the API key as a query parameter to the request URL. If the `location` is "header", it adds the API key as a header to the request.
