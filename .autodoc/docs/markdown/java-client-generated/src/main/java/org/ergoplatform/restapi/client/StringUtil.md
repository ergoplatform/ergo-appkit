The `StringUtil` class provides two utility methods for working with strings. The first method, `containsIgnoreCase`, takes an array of strings and a value to search for, and returns true if the array contains the value (case-insensitive comparison). If the value is null, the method returns true if any element in the array is also null. This method can be useful for checking if a certain value is present in an array of strings, regardless of case.

Example usage:
```
String[] fruits = {"apple", "banana", "orange"};
boolean containsApple = StringUtil.containsIgnoreCase(fruits, "Apple"); // returns true
boolean containsGrape = StringUtil.containsIgnoreCase(fruits, "grape"); // returns false
```

The second method, `join`, takes an array of strings and a separator, and returns a string that concatenates all the elements in the array with the separator in between. This method can be useful for constructing strings from arrays of values.

Example usage:
```
String[] words = {"hello", "world", "!"};
String sentence = StringUtil.join(words, " "); // returns "hello world !"
```

Note that the `join` method is implemented using a `StringBuilder` to efficiently concatenate the strings. The method also handles the case where the input array is empty, returning an empty string in that case.

Overall, the `StringUtil` class provides simple but useful string manipulation methods that can be used throughout the larger project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file is a StringUtil class that contains two methods for checking if an array contains a value (with case-insensitive comparison) and joining an array of strings with a separator.

2. Why is the containsIgnoreCase method checking for null values?
- The containsIgnoreCase method is checking for null values because if both the value and the string in the array are null, it should return true.

3. Why does the join method mention the possibility of being replaced by a utility method from commons-lang or guava?
- The join method mentions the possibility of being replaced by a utility method from commons-lang or guava because those libraries might have a similar method that can be used instead, and if one of those libraries is added as a dependency, it would be more efficient to use their method instead of this custom implementation.
