The `BlockHeader` class is part of the Ergo Node API and provides a model for the block header data structure. The block header contains metadata about a block in the blockchain, such as its ID, timestamp, version, and various hashes. This class defines the properties of a block header and provides getters and setters for each property.

The class contains fields for the block ID, timestamp, version, adProofsRoot, stateRoot, transactionsRoot, nBits, extensionHash, powSolutions, height, difficulty, parentId, votes, size, extensionId, transactionsId, and adProofsId. Each field has a corresponding getter and setter method. The `@SerializedName` annotation is used to specify the JSON field name for each property.

The class also includes methods for equality checking, hashing, and string representation. These methods are used to compare and manipulate instances of the `BlockHeader` class.

This class is generated automatically by the Swagger code generator program and should not be edited manually. It is used by other classes in the Ergo Node API to represent block headers in the blockchain. For example, the `BlockSummary` class contains a `BlockHeader` object as one of its properties. Developers can use this class to interact with the Ergo blockchain and retrieve information about blocks and transactions. 

Example usage:

```java
BlockHeader blockHeader = new BlockHeader();
blockHeader.setId("12345");
blockHeader.setTimestamp(1625678900L);
blockHeader.setVersion(1);
blockHeader.setAdProofsRoot("adProofsRootHash");
blockHeader.setStateRoot("stateRootHash");
blockHeader.setTransactionsRoot("transactionsRootHash");
blockHeader.setNBits(19857408L);
blockHeader.setExtensionHash("extensionHash");
blockHeader.setPowSolutions(new PowSolutions());
blockHeader.setHeight(667);
blockHeader.setDifficulty(BigInteger.valueOf(62));
blockHeader.setParentId("parentBlockId");
blockHeader.setVotes("votes");
blockHeader.setSize(1024);
blockHeader.setExtensionId("extensionId");
blockHeader.setTransactionsId("transactionsId");
blockHeader.setAdProofsId("adProofsId");

String blockId = blockHeader.getId();
Long timestamp = blockHeader.getTimestamp();
Integer version = blockHeader.getVersion();
// ... get other properties

System.out.println(blockHeader.toString());
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a Java class called `BlockHeader` which represents a block header in the Ergo blockchain. It contains various fields such as `id`, `timestamp`, `version`, `adProofsRoot`, etc.

2. What is the significance of the `@SerializedName` and `@Schema` annotations?
- The `@SerializedName` annotation is used to specify the name of the JSON property that corresponds to a particular Java field when serializing or deserializing JSON data. The `@Schema` annotation is used to provide additional information about a field such as its description, example value, and whether it is required.

3. What is the purpose of the `equals`, `hashCode`, and `toString` methods?
- These methods are used to implement object equality, hashing, and string representation respectively. They are commonly used in Java classes to enable comparison and printing of objects.
