This code defines a Java class called `PreHeader` that represents a pre-header of a block in the Ergo blockchain. The pre-header contains metadata about the block, such as its timestamp, version, difficulty target, height, parent block ID, votes, and miner public key. 

The class has getters and setters for each of these fields, as well as methods for chaining setters together. It also overrides the `equals`, `hashCode`, and `toString` methods for comparing instances of the class and generating string representations of them.

This class is likely used in the larger Ergo project to represent pre-headers of blocks in the blockchain. It may be used by other classes or modules that need to manipulate or analyze block metadata. For example, it could be used by a mining module to construct new blocks, or by a validation module to verify the correctness of existing blocks. 

Here is an example of how this class could be used to create a new block pre-header:

```
PreHeader preHeader = new PreHeader()
    .timestamp(1631234567)
    .version(1)
    .nBits(19857408L)
    .height(667)
    .parentId("0000000000000000000abcde1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567")
    .votes("0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000")
    .minerPk("0279be667ef9dcbbac55a06295ce870b07029bfcdb2dce28d959f2815b16f81798");
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a Java class called `PreHeader` which represents a pre-header of a block in the Ergo blockchain.

2. What are the required fields for a `PreHeader` object?
- The required fields for a `PreHeader` object are `timestamp`, `version`, `nBits`, `height`, `parentId`, and `votes`.

3. What is the format of the `minerPk` field?
- The `minerPk` field is a string that represents the public key of the miner who mined the block. It is in hexadecimal format.
