This code defines a Java class called `AdditionalRegisters` which extends the `java.util.HashMap` class. The purpose of this class is to represent a collection of `AdditionalRegister` objects, where each object is associated with a unique string key. 

The `AdditionalRegisters` class overrides the `equals` and `hashCode` methods inherited from the `HashMap` class to ensure that two `AdditionalRegisters` objects are considered equal if they contain the same set of key-value pairs. The `toString` method is also overridden to provide a string representation of the object.

This class is likely used in the larger project to represent a set of additional registers associated with a particular transaction or block in the Ergo blockchain. The `AdditionalRegister` class is likely defined elsewhere in the project and contains information about a single additional register, such as its type and value. 

An example of how this class might be used in the project is to retrieve the additional registers associated with a particular transaction. This could be done by calling a method on a `Transaction` object that returns an `AdditionalRegisters` object. The returned object could then be used to access the individual `AdditionalRegister` objects by their keys. For example:

```
Transaction tx = getTransactionById("abc123");
AdditionalRegisters additionalRegs = tx.getAdditionalRegisters();
AdditionalRegister reg1 = additionalRegs.get("key1");
AdditionalRegister reg2 = additionalRegs.get("key2");
```

In this example, `getTransactionById` is a method that retrieves a `Transaction` object by its ID. The `getAdditionalRegisters` method returns an `AdditionalRegisters` object associated with the transaction, which can then be used to retrieve the individual `AdditionalRegister` objects by their keys.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `AdditionalRegisters` class?
- The `AdditionalRegisters` class is a subclass of `java.util.HashMap` and represents a collection of `AdditionalRegister` objects.

2. What is the significance of the `equals` and `hashCode` methods in this class?
- The `equals` and `hashCode` methods are used for object comparison and hashing, respectively. They are overridden in this class to compare and hash the contents of the `HashMap`.

3. Why is the `toString` method overridden in this class?
- The `toString` method is overridden to provide a custom string representation of the `AdditionalRegisters` object. It calls the `toIndentedString` method to format the output with indentation.
