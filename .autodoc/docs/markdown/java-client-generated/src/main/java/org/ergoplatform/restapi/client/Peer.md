The `Peer` class is part of the Ergo Node API and is used to model a peer in the Ergo network. The class contains fields for the peer's address, name, REST API URL, last message, last handshake, and connection type. The `ConnectionTypeEnum` enum is used to represent the type of connection, which can be either incoming or outgoing.

The `Peer` class provides getters and setters for each field, allowing other classes to access and modify the peer's properties. The `toString()` method is also overridden to provide a string representation of the peer object.

This class is generated automatically by the Swagger code generator program and should not be edited manually. It is used by other classes in the Ergo Node API to represent a peer in the network. For example, the `PeersApi` class uses the `Peer` class to return a list of peers in the network.

Example usage:

```java
// create a new peer object
Peer peer = new Peer();

// set the peer's address
peer.setAddress("127.0.0.1:5673");

// set the peer's name
peer.setName("mynode");

// set the peer's REST API URL
peer.setRestApiUrl("http://127.0.0.1:9052");

// set the peer's last message time
peer.setLastMessage(123456789L);

// set the peer's last handshake time
peer.setLastHandshake(1234567890L);

// set the peer's connection type
peer.setConnectionType(ConnectionTypeEnum.INCOMING);

// print the peer object
System.out.println(peer.toString());
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a Java class called `Peer` that represents a peer node in the Ergo blockchain network.

2. What is the significance of the `ConnectionTypeEnum` enum?
- The `ConnectionTypeEnum` enum defines the type of connection between two peer nodes, either incoming or outgoing.

3. What is the purpose of the `toIndentedString` method?
- The `toIndentedString` method is a helper method that converts an object to a string with each line indented by 4 spaces, except the first line. It is used in the `toString` method to format the output of the `Peer` class.
