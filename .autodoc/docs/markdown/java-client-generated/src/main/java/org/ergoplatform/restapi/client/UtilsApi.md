The `UtilsApi` interface is part of the `ergo-appkit` project and provides a set of utility functions that can be used to interact with the Ergo blockchain. The interface defines six methods that can be used to perform various operations such as converting an address to its raw representation, checking the validity of an address, generating an Ergo address from an ErgoTree, generating a random seed, returning the Blake2b hash of a message, and generating a Pay-To-Public-Key address from a hex-encoded raw public key.

The `addressToRaw` method takes an address as input and returns its raw representation in hex-encoded serialized curve point format. This method can be used to extract the public key from an address.

The `checkAddressValidity` method takes an address as input and returns an `AddressValidity` object that indicates whether the address is valid or not. This method can be used to validate an address before using it in a transaction.

The `ergoTreeToAddress` method takes an ErgoTree in hex-encoded format as input and returns the corresponding Ergo address. This method can be used to derive an address from an ErgoTree.

The `getRandomSeed` method returns a random seed of 32 bytes. This method can be used to generate a random seed for use in a transaction.

The `getRandomSeedWithLength` method takes a length in bytes as input and returns a random seed of the specified length. This method can be used to generate a random seed of a specific length for use in a transaction.

The `hashBlake2b` method takes a message as input and returns its Blake2b hash. This method can be used to compute the hash of a message.

The `rawToAddress` method takes a hex-encoded raw public key as input and returns the corresponding Pay-To-Public-Key address. This method can be used to generate an address from a raw public key.

Overall, the `UtilsApi` interface provides a set of utility functions that can be used to interact with the Ergo blockchain. These functions can be used to perform various operations such as validating addresses, generating random seeds, computing hashes, and deriving addresses from ErgoTrees and raw public keys.
