The `ScanIdsBox` class is part of the Ergo Node API and is used to represent an Ergo box with associated scans. The class contains two fields: `scanIds` and `box`. The `scanIds` field is a list of integers representing the identifiers of the associated scans, while the `box` field is an instance of the `ErgoTransactionOutput` class representing the Ergo box.

The `ScanIdsBox` class provides methods to set and get the values of these fields. The `scanIds` field can be set using the `scanIds` method, which takes a list of integers as input. The `addScanIdsItem` method can be used to add individual integers to the `scanIds` list. The `getScanIds` method returns the list of scan IDs.

The `box` field can be set using the `box` method, which takes an instance of the `ErgoTransactionOutput` class as input. The `getBox` method returns the `ErgoTransactionOutput` instance.

The `ScanIdsBox` class also provides methods to override the `equals`, `hashCode`, and `toString` methods inherited from the `Object` class. The `equals` method compares two `ScanIdsBox` instances for equality based on the values of their `scanIds` and `box` fields. The `hashCode` method returns a hash code value for the `ScanIdsBox` instance based on the values of its `scanIds` and `box` fields. The `toString` method returns a string representation of the `ScanIdsBox` instance, including the values of its `scanIds` and `box` fields.

This class can be used in the larger project to represent an Ergo box with associated scans. It can be used to create, modify, and query Ergo boxes with associated scans. For example, the `ScanIdsBox` class can be used to create a new Ergo box with associated scans by setting the `scanIds` and `box` fields and passing the resulting `ScanIdsBox` instance to a method that creates a new Ergo box. Similarly, the `ScanIdsBox` class can be used to modify an existing Ergo box with associated scans by retrieving the `ScanIdsBox` instance representing the box, modifying its `scanIds` and/or `box` fields, and passing the modified `ScanIdsBox` instance to a method that updates the Ergo box. Finally, the `ScanIdsBox` class can be used to query an existing Ergo box with associated scans by retrieving the `ScanIdsBox` instance representing the box and accessing its `scanIds` and `box` fields.
