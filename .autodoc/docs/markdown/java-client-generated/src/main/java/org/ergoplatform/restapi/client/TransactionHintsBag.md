The `TransactionHintsBag` class is part of the Ergo Node API and provides a model for prover hints extracted from a transaction. The purpose of this class is to store two lists of `InputHints` objects: `secretHints` and `publicHints`. 

`InputHints` objects contain hints for inputs of a transaction, which can be used by a prover to construct a proof of correctness for the transaction. The `secretHints` list contains hints that contain secrets and should not be shared, while the `publicHints` list contains hints that only contain public data and can be shared freely.

This class provides methods to add and retrieve `InputHints` objects from both lists. The `addSecretHintsItem` and `addPublicHintsItem` methods allow for adding new `InputHints` objects to their respective lists. The `getSecretHints` and `getPublicHints` methods retrieve the entire lists of `InputHints` objects.

The class also provides methods for overriding the default `equals`, `hashCode`, and `toString` methods. The `equals` method compares two `TransactionHintsBag` objects for equality based on the equality of their `secretHints` and `publicHints` lists. The `hashCode` method returns a hash code value for the object based on the hash codes of its `secretHints` and `publicHints` lists. The `toString` method returns a string representation of the object, including its `secretHints` and `publicHints` lists.

This class can be used in the larger Ergo Node API project to represent prover hints extracted from a transaction. It can be used to store and retrieve `InputHints` objects for inputs of a transaction, and to distinguish between hints that contain secrets and hints that only contain public data.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a Java class called `TransactionHintsBag` that contains two lists of `InputHints` objects, one for secret hints and one for public hints, extracted from a transaction.

2. What is the expected input and output of this code?
- This code does not have any input or output, as it only defines a class and its properties and methods.

3. What is the significance of the `InputHints` class?
- The `InputHints` class is used to represent hints extracted from a transaction, which can be used to help construct a proof of correctness for the transaction. The `TransactionHintsBag` class contains two lists of `InputHints` objects, one for secret hints and one for public hints.
