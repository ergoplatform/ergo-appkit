The `CryptoResult` class is part of the Ergo Node API and is used to represent the result of an `executeWithContext` request. Specifically, it represents the result of reducing a Sigma Boolean expression to a cryptographic value. 

The class has two fields: `value` and `cost`. The `value` field is of type `SigmaBoolean` and represents the cryptographic value resulting from the reduction of the Sigma Boolean expression. The `cost` field is of type `Long` and represents the estimated cost of executing the contract.

The `CryptoResult` class provides methods for setting and getting the values of its fields. The `value` field is required and must be set using the `value` method. The `cost` field is also required and must be set using the `cost` method.

The class also provides methods for comparing instances of `CryptoResult` for equality and generating a string representation of an instance. These methods are used for debugging and testing purposes.

In the larger project, the `CryptoResult` class is used to represent the result of reducing a Sigma Boolean expression to a cryptographic value. This result is then used in other parts of the project to perform various operations, such as verifying transactions and executing smart contracts. For example, the `CryptoResult` class may be used in conjunction with the `Transaction` class to verify that a transaction is valid. 

Overall, the `CryptoResult` class is an important part of the Ergo Node API and is used to represent the result of reducing a Sigma Boolean expression to a cryptographic value.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code defines a Java class called `CryptoResult` that represents the result of an executeWithContext request in the Ergo Node API. It contains a SigmaBoolean value and an estimated cost of contract execution.

2. What is the significance of the `@Schema` annotation?
    
    The `@Schema` annotation is used to provide metadata about the class and its properties for use in generating API documentation. It includes a description of the class and its properties.

3. What is the purpose of the `toIndentedString` method?
    
    The `toIndentedString` method is a helper method used to convert an object to a string with each line indented by 4 spaces. It is used in the `toString` method to format the output of the `CryptoResult` class.
