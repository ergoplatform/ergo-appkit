The `WorkMessage` class is part of the Ergo Node API and provides a model for block candidate related data that can be used by an external miner to perform work. This class contains five fields: `msg`, `b`, `h`, `pk`, and `proof`. 

The `msg` field is a string that represents the base16-encoded block header bytes without PoW solution. The `b` field is a BigInteger that represents the work target value. The `h` field is an integer that represents the work target value. The `pk` field is a string that represents the base16-encoded miner public key. The `proof` field is an instance of the `ProofOfUpcomingTransactions` class, which is another model class in the Ergo Node API.

This class provides getter and setter methods for each field, allowing the user to set and retrieve the values of each field. Additionally, the class provides methods for converting the object to a string and for checking equality between two `WorkMessage` objects.

This class can be used in the larger project by creating instances of `WorkMessage` and passing them to other parts of the Ergo Node API that require block candidate related data for external miners to perform work. For example, a miner could use an instance of `WorkMessage` to perform work on a block candidate and submit the result to the Ergo network. 

Example usage:

```
WorkMessage workMessage = new WorkMessage()
    .msg("0350e25cee8562697d55275c96bb01b34228f9bd68fd9933f2a25ff195526864f5")
    .b(new BigInteger("987654321"))
    .h(12345)
    .pk("0350e25cee8562697d55275c96bb01b34228f9bd68fd9933f2a25ff195526864f5")
    .proof(new ProofOfUpcomingTransactions());
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a Java class called `WorkMessage` that contains block candidate related data for external miners to perform work.

2. What are the required fields for a `WorkMessage` object?
- A `WorkMessage` object requires a `msg` field (base16-encoded block header bytes without PoW solution), a `b` field (work target value), an `h` field (work target value), a `pk` field (base16-encoded miner public key), and a `proof` field (an object of type `ProofOfUpcomingTransactions`).

3. What is the purpose of the `equals`, `hashCode`, and `toString` methods in this class?
- The `equals` method compares two `WorkMessage` objects for equality based on their `msg`, `b`, `pk`, and `proof` fields.
- The `hashCode` method generates a hash code for a `WorkMessage` object based on its `msg`, `b`, `pk`, and `proof` fields.
- The `toString` method generates a string representation of a `WorkMessage` object that includes its `msg`, `b`, `pk`, and `proof` fields.
