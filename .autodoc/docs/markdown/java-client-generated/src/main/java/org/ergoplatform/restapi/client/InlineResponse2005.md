This code defines a Java class called `InlineResponse2005` which is used to represent a response from the Ergo Node API. Specifically, this response contains a single field called `rewardAddress` which is a string representing the address to which mining rewards are paid out. 

The class includes a constructor, a getter and setter method for the `rewardAddress` field, and several methods for comparing and converting the object to a string. The `equals` method compares two `InlineResponse2005` objects for equality based on their `rewardAddress` fields, while the `hashCode` method generates a hash code for the object based on its `rewardAddress` field. The `toString` method generates a string representation of the object, including its `rewardAddress` field.

This class is likely used in conjunction with other classes and methods in the Ergo Node API to retrieve information about the Ergo blockchain. For example, a client application might make a request to the API to retrieve the reward address for a particular block or transaction, and receive an `InlineResponse2005` object as the response. The client application could then use the `getRewardAddress` method to extract the reward address from the response and use it for further processing. 

Here is an example of how this class might be used in a client application:

```
ApiClient apiClient = new ApiClient();
InlineResponse2005 response = apiClient.getBlockRewardAddress(blockId);
String rewardAddress = response.getRewardAddress();
System.out.println("The reward address for block " + blockId + " is " + rewardAddress);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a Java class called `InlineResponse2005` which has a single property called `rewardAddress`.

2. What is the expected input and output of this code?
- There is no input expected for this code. The output is a Java class with a getter and setter method for the `rewardAddress` property.

3. What is the significance of the annotations used in this code?
- The `@SerializedName` annotation is used to specify the name of the JSON property that corresponds to the `rewardAddress` field when serialized and deserialized. The `@Schema` annotation is used to provide additional information about the `rewardAddress` field for documentation purposes. The `@JsonAdapter` annotation is used to specify a custom TypeAdapter for the class.
