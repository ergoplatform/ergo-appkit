The `Body1` class is a model class that represents a request body for a specific API endpoint in the Ergo Node API. Specifically, this class is used for the `/wallet/mnemonic` endpoint, which is used to create a new wallet from a mnemonic seed. 

The class has three fields: `pass`, `mnemonic`, and `mnemonicPass`. `pass` is a required field that represents the password to encrypt the wallet file with. `mnemonic` is also a required field that represents the mnemonic seed used to generate the wallet. `mnemonicPass` is an optional field that represents a password to password-protect the mnemonic seed. 

The class provides getter and setter methods for each field, as well as an `equals` method, a `hashCode` method, and a `toString` method. These methods are used to compare instances of the class, generate hash codes for instances of the class, and generate string representations of instances of the class, respectively. 

Developers using the Ergo Node API can use this class to create a request body for the `/wallet/mnemonic` endpoint. For example, the following code creates a `Body1` instance with the required fields set:

```
Body1 body = new Body1()
    .pass("myPassword")
    .mnemonic("myMnemonicSeed");
```

The `body` instance can then be used as the request body when making a request to the `/wallet/mnemonic` endpoint.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a Java class called `Body1` that represents a request body for a specific API endpoint in the Ergo Node API.

2. What are the required fields for an instance of this class?
- An instance of `Body1` must have a non-null `pass` and `mnemonic` field.

3. What is the purpose of the `mnemonicPass` field?
- The `mnemonicPass` field is an optional field that can be used to password-protect the `mnemonic` field.
