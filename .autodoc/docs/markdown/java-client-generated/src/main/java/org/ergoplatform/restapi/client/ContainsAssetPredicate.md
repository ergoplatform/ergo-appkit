The `ContainsAssetPredicate` class is part of the Ergo Node API and is used to represent a scanning predicate for searching for a specific asset in a transaction. This class extends the `ScanningPredicate` class and adds an `assetId` field to represent the ID of the asset being searched for.

This class is generated automatically by the Swagger code generator program and should not be edited manually. It includes methods for setting and getting the `assetId` field, as well as methods for checking equality and generating a string representation of the object.

In the larger project, this class may be used to create scanning predicates for searching for specific assets in transactions. For example, a developer could create a `ContainsAssetPredicate` object with a specific `assetId` and use it to search for transactions that contain that asset. This could be useful for tracking the movement of a particular asset or for verifying that a transaction contains the expected assets before it is broadcast to the network.

Here is an example of how this class could be used in code:

```
ContainsAssetPredicate predicate = new ContainsAssetPredicate();
predicate.assetId("abcdef1234567890");
```

This code creates a new `ContainsAssetPredicate` object and sets its `assetId` field to "abcdef1234567890". This object could then be used to search for transactions that contain the asset with that ID.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines a Java class called `ContainsAssetPredicate` which extends another class called `ScanningPredicate`. It contains a field called `assetId` and methods to get and set its value.

2. What is the relationship between `ContainsAssetPredicate` and `ScanningPredicate`?
   - `ContainsAssetPredicate` extends `ScanningPredicate`, which means it inherits all of its fields and methods. This suggests that `ContainsAssetPredicate` is a more specific type of `ScanningPredicate`.

3. What is the purpose of the `toIndentedString` method?
   - The `toIndentedString` method is a private helper method that converts an object to a string with each line indented by 4 spaces. It is used in the `toString` method to format the output of the `ContainsAssetPredicate` class.
