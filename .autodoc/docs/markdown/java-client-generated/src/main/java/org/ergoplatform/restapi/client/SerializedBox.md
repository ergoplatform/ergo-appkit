The `SerializedBox` class is part of the Ergo Node API and is used to represent a serialized box. A box in Ergo is a data structure that holds assets and can be locked by a script. The purpose of this class is to provide a standardized way of serializing and deserializing boxes in the Ergo platform.

The class has two fields: `boxId` and `bytes`. `boxId` is a string that represents the unique identifier of the box, while `bytes` is a string that represents the serialized bytes of the box. The `boxId` field is required, while the `bytes` field is optional.

The class provides getter and setter methods for both fields, as well as methods for equality checking, hashing, and string representation.

This class can be used in the larger Ergo Node API project to represent serialized boxes in requests and responses. For example, a request to create a new box might include a `SerializedBox` object in the request body, while a response to a query for box information might include a list of `SerializedBox` objects.

Here is an example of how this class might be used in a request to create a new box:

```
SerializedBox newBox = new SerializedBox();
newBox.boxId("12345");
newBox.bytes("ABCDEF123456");

// Use newBox in request body
```

In this example, a new `SerializedBox` object is created and its `boxId` and `bytes` fields are set. The `newBox` object can then be used in the request body to create a new box.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a model for a SerializedBox in the Ergo Node API.

2. What is the significance of the @SerializedName and @Schema annotations?
- The @SerializedName annotation is used to specify the serialized name of a field in JSON. The @Schema annotation is used to provide additional information about a field for documentation purposes.

3. What is the purpose of the equals and hashCode methods?
- The equals and hashCode methods are used for object comparison and hashing, respectively. They are necessary for certain operations such as adding objects to collections.
