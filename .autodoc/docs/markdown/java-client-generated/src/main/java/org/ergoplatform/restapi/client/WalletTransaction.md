The `WalletTransaction` class is part of the `ergo-appkit` project and is used to represent a transaction with additional information. This class is generated automatically by the Swagger code generator program and should not be edited manually. 

The `WalletTransaction` class has several properties that describe a transaction, including `id`, `inputs`, `dataInputs`, `outputs`, `inclusionHeight`, `numConfirmations`, `scans`, and `size`. 

The `id` property is a string that uniquely identifies the transaction. The `inputs` property is a list of `ErgoTransactionInput` objects that represent the inputs to the transaction. The `dataInputs` property is a list of `ErgoTransactionDataInput` objects that represent the data inputs to the transaction. The `outputs` property is a list of `ErgoTransactionOutput` objects that represent the outputs of the transaction. 

The `inclusionHeight` property is an integer that represents the height of the block in which the transaction was included. The `numConfirmations` property is an integer that represents the number of confirmations the transaction has received. The `scans` property is a list of integers that represent the scan identifiers the transaction relates to. Finally, the `size` property is an integer that represents the size of the transaction in bytes.

This class can be used to represent a transaction in the Ergo blockchain and can be used in conjunction with other classes in the `ergo-appkit` project to build applications that interact with the Ergo blockchain. For example, a developer could use this class to create a wallet application that displays transaction information to the user. 

Here is an example of how to create a `WalletTransaction` object:

```
ErgoTransactionInput input = new ErgoTransactionInput();
ErgoTransactionDataInput dataInput = new ErgoTransactionDataInput();
ErgoTransactionOutput output = new ErgoTransactionOutput();

List<ErgoTransactionInput> inputs = new ArrayList<>();
inputs.add(input);

List<ErgoTransactionDataInput> dataInputs = new ArrayList<>();
dataInputs.add(dataInput);

List<ErgoTransactionOutput> outputs = new ArrayList<>();
outputs.add(output);

WalletTransaction transaction = new WalletTransaction()
    .id("transactionId")
    .inputs(inputs)
    .dataInputs(dataInputs)
    .outputs(outputs)
    .inclusionHeight(20998)
    .numConfirmations(1)
    .scans(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3))
    .size(100);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a Java class called `WalletTransaction` that represents a transaction with additional information such as inclusion height, number of confirmations, and scan identifiers.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code uses the `com.google.gson` and `io.swagger.v3.oas.annotations` libraries.

3. What are some of the key attributes and methods of the `WalletTransaction` class?
- Some key attributes of the `WalletTransaction` class include `id`, `inputs`, `dataInputs`, `outputs`, `inclusionHeight`, `numConfirmations`, `scans`, and `size`. Some key methods include getters and setters for these attributes, as well as `addInputsItem()`, `addDataInputsItem()`, and `addOutputsItem()` methods for adding items to the corresponding lists.
