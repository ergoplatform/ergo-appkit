The `OutBoxBuilder` interface is a part of the `ergo-appkit` project and is used to build a new output box that can be included in a new unsigned transaction. When the transaction is signed, sent to the blockchain, and then included by miners in a new block, the output constructed using this builder will be added to the UTXO set.

The `OutBoxBuilder` interface has several methods that can be used to configure the output box. The `value` method is used to configure the Erg amount of the output box. The `contract` method is used to configure the guarding contract of the output box. This contract will be compiled into ErgoTree, serialized, and then sent to the blockchain as part of the signed transaction. The `tokens` method is used to configure amounts for one or more tokens. Each Ergo box can store zero or more tokens. The `mintToken` method is used to mint a new token according to the EIP-0004 standard. The `registers` method is used to configure one or more optional registers of the output box. Each box has 4 mandatory registers holding the value of NanoErgs, guarding script, tokens, and creation info. Optional registers numbered from index 4 up to 9. The `creationHeight` method is used to configure the height when the transaction containing the box was created. This height, when explicitly specified, should not exceed the height of the block containing the transaction with this output box.

The `build` method is used to create an `OutBox` instance using the specified parameters. The output box can be added to an unsigned transaction using the `UnsignedTransactionBuilder` class.

Here is an example of how to use the `OutBoxBuilder` interface to create an output box:

```
OutBoxBuilder outBoxBuilder = unsignedTxBuilder.outBoxBuilder()
    .value(1000000000L)
    .contract(new ErgoTreeContract(new ErgoTree(new byte[] {0x01, 0x02, 0x03})))
    .tokens(new ErgoToken("Token1", 100), new ErgoToken("Token2", 200))
    .registers(new LongConstant(12345L), new ByteArrayConstant(new byte[] {0x01, 0x02, 0x03}))
    .creationHeight(1000);

OutBox outBox = outBoxBuilder.build();
unsignedTxBuilder.outputs(outBox);
```

In this example, an `OutBoxBuilder` instance is created using the `outBoxBuilder` method of an `UnsignedTransactionBuilder` instance. The `value` method is used to set the Erg amount of the output box to 1000000000L. The `contract` method is used to set the guarding contract of the output box to an `ErgoTreeContract` instance. The `tokens` method is used to set the amounts for two tokens. The `registers` method is used to set two optional registers of the output box. The `creationHeight` method is used to set the height when the transaction containing the box was created to 1000. Finally, the `build` method is used to create an `OutBox` instance, which is added to the unsigned transaction using the `outputs` method of the `UnsignedTransactionBuilder` instance.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this interface and how is it used in the Ergo platform?
- This interface is used to build a new output box that can be included in a new unsigned transaction. When the transaction is signed, sent to the blockchain, and included by miners in a new block, the output constructed using this builder will be added to the UTXO set.

2. What are the different methods available in this interface and what do they do?
- The `value` method configures the Erg amount of the output box. The `contract` method configures the guarding contract of the output box. The `tokens` method configures amounts for one or more tokens. The `mintToken` method mints a new token. The `registers` method configures one or more optional registers of the output box. The `creationHeight` method configures the height when the transaction containing the box was created. The `build` method creates an `OutBox` instance using the specified parameters.

3. What is the relationship between this interface and other classes in the Ergo platform?
- This interface is used in conjunction with other classes in the Ergo platform, such as `UnsignedTransactionBuilder`, `ErgoContract`, `ErgoToken`, `Eip4Token`, `ErgoValue`, `BlockchainContext`, and `OutBox`. It is used to build output boxes that can be added to unsigned transactions, which can then be signed and sent to the blockchain.
