The `InputBoxesValidator` class is a box selector implementation that performs validation and calculates the necessary change box. It is part of the `ergo-appkit` project and is used to build transactions. Unlike the `DefaultBoxSelector` from `ergo-wallet`, this selector does not select input boxes. Instead, it validates the input boxes and calculates the necessary change box.

The `InputBoxesValidator` class extends the `BoxSelector` trait and overrides its `select` method. The `select` method takes an iterator of input boxes, an external filter, a target balance, and target assets. It returns either a `BoxSelectionResult` or a `BoxSelectionError`. The `BoxSelectionResult` contains the selected input boxes and the change boxes, while the `BoxSelectionError` contains an error message.

The `InputBoxesValidator` class also has a `formChangeBoxes` method that constructs change outputs. It takes the found balance, target balance, found box assets, and target box assets. It returns either a sequence of `ErgoBoxAssets` or a `BoxSelectionError`. The `ErgoBoxAssets` contains the balance and assets of a box.

The `InputBoxesValidator` class uses mutable structures to collect results. It selects all input boxes and validates them. It then checks if it found all the required tokens. If it did, it constructs the change boxes using the `formChangeBoxes` method. If it did not, it returns a `NotEnoughTokensError`. If it did not find enough ERGs, it returns a `NotEnoughErgsError`.

In summary, the `InputBoxesValidator` class is a box selector implementation that performs validation and calculates the necessary change box. It is used to build transactions in the `ergo-appkit` project. It selects all input boxes, validates them, and constructs the change boxes. If it encounters an error, it returns a `BoxSelectionError`.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it differ from DefaultBoxSelector from ergo-wallet?
- This code is a pass-through implementation of the box selector that performs validation and calculates the necessary change box. Unlike DefaultBoxSelector from ergo-wallet, it does not select input boxes as it is done in appkit.

2. What is the role of the formChangeBoxes method?
- The formChangeBoxes method is a helper method that constructs change outputs. It takes in the found balance, target balance, found box assets, and target box assets, and returns either an error or a sequence of ErgoBoxAssets representing the change boxes.

3. What happens if there are not enough tokens in the input boxes to send the target assets?
- If there are not enough tokens in the input boxes to send the target assets, the code will return a NotEnoughTokensError with a message indicating that there are not enough tokens in the input boxes to send the target assets.
