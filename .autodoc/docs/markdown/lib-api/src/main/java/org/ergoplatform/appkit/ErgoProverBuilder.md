The `ErgoProverBuilder` interface is used to configure and build a new `ErgoProver` instance. The `ErgoProver` is used to generate proofs for spending Ergo tokens. The `ErgoProverBuilder` interface provides several methods to configure the `ErgoProver` instance.

The `withMnemonic` method is used to configure the `ErgoProverBuilder` to use a secret seed phrase and password to generate proofs. The `usePre1627KeyDerivation` parameter is used to specify whether to use the previous BIP32 derivation or not. The `withMnemonic` method can also be used to configure the `ErgoProverBuilder` to use a `Mnemonic` instance containing the secret seed phrase.

The `withEip3Secret` method is used to configure the `ErgoProverBuilder` to derive the new EIP-3 secret key with the given index. The derivation uses the master key derived from the mnemonic configured using the `withMnemonic` method.

The `withSecretStorage` method is used to configure the `ErgoProverBuilder` to use a `SecretStorage` instance containing an encrypted secret seed phrase to generate proofs.

The `withDHTData` method is used to configure the `ErgoProverBuilder` to use group elements and a secret integer for a ProveDHTuple statement when building a new `ErgoProver`. The ProveDHTuple statement consists of 4 group elements and requires the prover to prove knowledge of a secret integer. The `withDLogSecret` method is used to add additional secrets for use in proveDlog when the secret is not part of the wallet.

The `build` method is used to build a new `ErgoProver` instance using the provided configuration.

Example usage:

```
ErgoProverBuilder builder = new ErgoProverBuilderImpl();
builder.withMnemonic(mnemonicPhrase, mnemonicPass, false);
builder.withEip3Secret(0);
ErgoProver prover = builder.build();
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines an interface for configuring and building a new ErgoProver, which is used for generating proofs in the Ergo blockchain.

2. What is the difference between `withMnemonic(SecretString, SecretString, Boolean)` and `withMnemonic(Mnemonic, Boolean)` methods?
- The first method takes a secret seed phrase and its password as separate arguments, while the second method takes a Mnemonic instance containing the seed phrase and its password. Additionally, the first method allows specifying whether to use an incorrect BIP32 derivation for old wallets, while the second method assumes the correct derivation for old wallets.

3. What is the purpose of the `withDHTData` method?
- This method configures the builder to use group elements and a secret integer for a ProveDHTuple statement, which requires proving knowledge of the secret integer x such that u = g^x and y = h^x. This is used for Diffie-Hellman tuple protocols in the Ergo blockchain.
