The `ErgoScriptContract` class is a part of the `ergo-appkit` project and implements the `ErgoContract` interface. It represents a smart contract on the Ergo blockchain and provides methods to interact with it. 

The class has three private fields: `_constants`, `_code`, and `_networkType`. `_constants` is an instance of the `Constants` class, which contains a map of constant values used in the contract. `_code` is a string that represents the ErgoScript code of the contract. `_networkType` is an instance of the `NetworkType` enum, which specifies the network type (Mainnet or Testnet) of the contract.

The class provides a public constructor that takes three parameters: `constants`, `code`, and `networkType`. It creates a new instance of the `ErgoScriptContract` class with the given parameters.

The class also provides several methods that implement the methods of the `ErgoContract` interface. The `getConstants()` method returns the `_constants` field. The `getErgoScript()` method returns the `_code` field.

The `substConstant(String name, Object value)` method creates a new instance of the `Constants` class with the same values as `_constants`, but with the value of the constant with the given `name` replaced with the given `value`. It then creates a new instance of the `ErgoScriptContract` class with the new `Constants` instance, the same `_code` value, and the same `_networkType` value.

The `getErgoTree()` method compiles the `_code` value into an `ErgoTree` instance using the `JavaHelpers.compile()` method. It takes the `_constants` instance, the `_code` value, and the network prefix of the `_networkType` instance as parameters. It then returns the resulting `ErgoTree` instance.

The `toAddress()` method returns an `Address` instance that represents the address of the contract on the Ergo blockchain. It does this by calling the `Address.fromErgoTree()` method with the `ErgoTree` instance returned by the `getErgoTree()` method and the `_networkType` instance as parameters.

Overall, the `ErgoScriptContract` class provides a convenient way to create and interact with smart contracts on the Ergo blockchain. It allows developers to specify the constant values and ErgoScript code of the contract, and provides methods to compile the code, get the contract address, and replace constant values.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code defines a class called `ErgoScriptContract` which implements the `ErgoContract` interface. It provides methods for creating and manipulating ErgoScript contracts, which are used in the Ergo blockchain to define transaction outputs and conditions for spending them.

2. What are the input parameters for creating a new instance of `ErgoScriptContract`?
- A new instance of `ErgoScriptContract` can be created by calling the static `create` method and passing in three parameters: a `Constants` object, a `String` containing the ErgoScript code, and a `NetworkType` object representing the network type (Mainnet, Testnet, or Regtest).

3. What is the purpose of the `substConstant` method and how does it work?
- The `substConstant` method takes in a `String` name and an `Object` value, and returns a new instance of `ErgoScriptContract` with the specified constant replaced by the new value. It works by cloning the original `Constants` object, replacing the specified constant, and creating a new `ErgoScriptContract` instance with the updated `Constants` object and the same ErgoScript code and network type.
