The `MnemonicValidationException` class is a custom exception class that is used to handle errors that may occur during the validation of a mnemonic phrase. A mnemonic phrase is a sequence of words that can be used to generate a cryptographic key. This class is part of the `ergo-appkit` project and is used to validate the mnemonic phrases used in the project.

The `MnemonicValidationException` class extends the `Exception` class, which is the base class for all exceptions in Java. It has two constructors, one with no arguments and one that takes a message string as an argument. The message string is used to provide additional information about the exception.

The `MnemonicValidationException` class also has three nested classes that extend it: `MnemonicEmptyException`, `MnemonicWrongListSizeException`, and `MnemonicChecksumException`. These classes are used to handle specific types of errors that may occur during the validation of a mnemonic phrase.

The `MnemonicEmptyException` class is thrown when an argument to the `MnemonicCode` is empty. The `MnemonicWrongListSizeException` class is thrown when an argument to the `MnemonicCode` is of the wrong list size. The `MnemonicChecksumException` class is thrown when a list of `MnemonicCode` words fails the checksum check.

The `MnemonicWordException` class is also a nested class that extends `MnemonicValidationException`. It is thrown when a word is encountered that is not in the `MnemonicCode`'s word list. This class contains a `badWord` field that contains the word that was not found in the word list.

Overall, the `MnemonicValidationException` class is an important part of the `ergo-appkit` project as it provides a way to handle errors that may occur during the validation of a mnemonic phrase. By using this class, developers can ensure that their code is robust and can handle errors gracefully. Here is an example of how this class can be used:

```
try {
    Mnemonic.checkEnglishMnemonic(mnemonicWords);
} catch (MnemonicValidationException e) {
    // Handle the exception here
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code defines a set of exceptions that can be raised when validating a mnemonic phrase in the Ergo Platform appkit.

2. What are the different types of exceptions that can be raised?
    
    There are four different types of exceptions that can be raised: `MnemonicEmptyException`, `MnemonicWrongListSizeException`, `MnemonicChecksumException`, and `MnemonicWordException`.

3. What information is contained in the `MnemonicWordException` exception?
    
    The `MnemonicWordException` exception contains the word that was not found in the word list that is being used to validate the mnemonic phrase.
