The `ErgoTreeContract` class is a part of the `ergo-appkit` project and implements the `ErgoContract` interface. It represents a smart contract on the Ergo blockchain and provides methods to interact with it. 

The class has two instance variables: `_ergoTree` of type `Values.ErgoTree` and `_networkType` of type `NetworkType`. The `_ergoTree` variable represents the ErgoTree of the smart contract, which is a serialized form of the contract script. The `_networkType` variable represents the network type on which the contract is deployed, either `MAINNET` or `TESTNET`.

The class provides four methods that are required by the `ErgoContract` interface. The `getConstants()` method returns the constants used in the contract, but it is not implemented in this class and throws a `RuntimeException`. The `getErgoScript()` method returns the serialized script of the contract, but it is also not implemented and throws a `RuntimeException`. The `substConstant(String name, Object value)` method substitutes a constant value in the contract script, but it is not implemented and throws a `RuntimeException`. The `getErgoTree()` method returns the `_ergoTree` instance variable, which represents the serialized script of the contract.

The `toAddress()` method returns the `Address` object of the contract. It uses the `_ergoTree` and `_networkType` instance variables to create an `Address` object using the `fromErgoTree()` method of the `Address` class.

This class can be used to represent a smart contract on the Ergo blockchain and to interact with it. It provides a way to get the serialized script of the contract and its constants, and to get the `Address` object of the contract. The `Address` object can be used to send Ergs or tokens to the contract, or to call its methods. 

Example usage:

```
Values.ErgoTree ergoTree = ... // get the serialized script of the contract
NetworkType networkType = NetworkType.MAINNET; // set the network type
ErgoTreeContract contract = new ErgoTreeContract(ergoTree, networkType); // create a contract object
Address address = contract.toAddress(); // get the address of the contract
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ErgoTreeContract` class?
    
    The `ErgoTreeContract` class is an implementation of the `ErgoContract` interface and represents a contract defined by an ErgoTree.

2. What is the significance of the `NetworkType` parameter in the constructor?
    
    The `NetworkType` parameter specifies the network type (Mainnet or Testnet) for which the contract is intended.

3. What is the purpose of the `substConstant` method?
    
    The `substConstant` method is intended to substitute a named constant in the contract with a new value. However, this method is not implemented and currently throws a `RuntimeException`.
