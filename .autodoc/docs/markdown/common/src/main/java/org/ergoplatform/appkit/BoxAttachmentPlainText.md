The `BoxAttachmentPlainText` class is a part of the `ergo-appkit` project and is used to represent an attachment containing a simple text. This class extends the `BoxAttachmentGeneric` class and adds a `text` field to store the content of the attachment as a string.

The constructor of this class takes an array of bytes as input, which represents the content of the attachment. It then calls the constructor of the `BoxAttachmentGeneric` class with the attachment type set to `Type.PLAIN_TEXT` and the attachment content set to the input byte array. The `text` field is then initialized by converting the input byte array to a string using the UTF-8 character set.

The `getText()` method simply returns the `text` field, which contains the content of the attachment as a string.

The `buildForText()` method is a static factory method that takes a string as input and returns a new instance of the `BoxAttachmentPlainText` class with the attachment content set to the input string. This method first converts the input string to a byte array using the UTF-8 character set and then calls the constructor of the `BoxAttachmentPlainText` class with the byte array as input.

This class can be used in the larger project to represent attachments containing simple text. For example, if the project needs to attach a message to a transaction, it can create a new instance of the `BoxAttachmentPlainText` class with the message content as input and add it to the transaction's outputs. The `getText()` method can then be used to retrieve the message content from the attachment.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   This code defines a class called `BoxAttachmentPlainText` which represents an attachment containing a simple text.

2. What is the difference between `BoxAttachmentPlainText` and `BoxAttachmentGeneric`?
   `BoxAttachmentPlainText` is a subclass of `BoxAttachmentGeneric` and adds a `text` field and a `getText()` method to represent plain text attachments specifically.

3. How can I create a new instance of `BoxAttachmentPlainText`?
   You can use the `buildForText()` method, which takes a `String` parameter and returns a new instance of `BoxAttachmentPlainText` with the UTF-8 encoded bytes of the text as the attachment content.
