The `Parameters` class in the `ergo-appkit` project contains a set of global parameters that are used by the Appkit library. These parameters are constants that are used throughout the project to ensure consistency and to simplify the code.

The first set of parameters, `MinerRewardDelay_Mainnet` and `MinerRewardDelay_Testnet`, are used to determine the number of blocks a miner must wait before they can spend the block reward. This is a part of the Ergo protocol and cannot be changed.

The second parameter, `OneErg`, is used to define the conversion rate between Erg and NanoErg. One Erg is equal to 10^9 NanoErg.

The third parameter, `MinFee`, is the minimum transaction fee in NanoErgs as defined by the Ergo protocol. This value is used to ensure that transactions are processed correctly and that the network is not overloaded with low-value transactions.

The fourth parameter, `MinChangeValue`, is the minimum value for a change output. If the computed change is less than this value, it is added to the fee and the change output is not added to the transaction. This helps to prevent dust outputs and ensures that transactions are processed efficiently.

The fifth parameter, `ColdClientMaxBlockCost`, is the maximum block cost for a cold client. This value is used to limit the amount of resources that a cold client can use when processing blocks.

The final parameter, `ColdClientBlockVersion`, is the activated version for a cold client. This value is used to ensure that the cold client is using the correct version of the Ergo protocol.

Overall, the `Parameters` class provides a set of constants that are used throughout the `ergo-appkit` project to ensure consistency and to simplify the code. These parameters are an important part of the Ergo protocol and are used to ensure that transactions are processed correctly and efficiently.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this Parameters class?
- The Parameters class contains global parameters used by the Appkit library.

2. What is the significance of the MinerRewardDelay_Mainnet and MinerRewardDelay_Testnet variables?
- These variables represent the number of blocks a miner should wait before being able to spend block rewards on the mainnet and testnet, respectively.

3. What is the purpose of the MinChangeValue variable?
- The MinChangeValue variable represents the minimum value for a change output in a transaction. If the computed change is less than this value, it is added to the fee and the change output is not added to the transaction.
