The `InputBoxesSelectionException` class is a custom exception that can be thrown in the `ergo-appkit` project. It extends the `RuntimeException` class, which means that it is an unchecked exception that does not need to be declared in a method's throws clause. 

This class has four nested classes that extend `InputBoxesSelectionException`. Each of these nested classes represents a specific type of error that can occur during the selection of input boxes for a transaction. 

The `InputBoxLimitExceededException` is thrown when the maximum number of input boxes has been set, but it does not cover the amount of ERG and/or tokens to be sent. This exception contains information about the remaining amount of ERG and tokens, as well as the box limit.

The `NotEnoughCoinsForChangeException` is thrown when a change box is needed, but the ERG amount in all input boxes is not enough to create the change box.

The `NotEnoughErgsException` is thrown when the required amount of ERG was not found in all available input boxes. This exception contains information about the balance found in the input boxes.

The `NotEnoughTokensException` is thrown when the required amount of a specific token was not found in all available input boxes. This exception contains information about the token balances found in the input boxes.

These exceptions can be used to handle errors that occur during the selection of input boxes for a transaction. For example, if the `NotEnoughErgsException` is thrown, the application can inform the user that they do not have enough ERG to complete the transaction and prompt them to add more funds to their wallet. 

Here is an example of how the `NotEnoughErgsException` can be caught and handled:

```
try {
    // code that selects input boxes for a transaction
} catch (InputBoxesSelectionException e) {
    if (e instanceof NotEnoughErgsException) {
        NotEnoughErgsException ex = (NotEnoughErgsException) e;
        System.out.println("Not enough ERG to complete transaction. Balance found: " + ex.balanceFound);
        // prompt user to add more funds to their wallet
    } else {
        // handle other types of exceptions
    }
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `InputBoxesSelectionException` class?
    
    The `InputBoxesSelectionException` class is a custom exception that is thrown when there is an error in selecting input boxes for a transaction.

2. What are the different types of exceptions that can be thrown by this class and when are they thrown?
    
    The different types of exceptions that can be thrown by this class are `InputBoxLimitExceededException`, `NotEnoughCoinsForChangeException`, `NotEnoughErgsException`, and `NotEnoughTokensException`. They are thrown in different scenarios such as when the maximum amount of input boxes is exceeded, when there are not enough coins to create a change box, when there are not enough ERG or tokens in the available boxes, etc.

3. What are the variables that can be accessed from the `InputBoxLimitExceededException` and `NotEnoughTokensException` classes?
    
    The `InputBoxLimitExceededException` class has three variables that can be accessed: `remainingAmount`, `remainingTokens`, and `boxLimit`. The `NotEnoughTokensException` class has one variable that can be accessed: `tokenBalances`.
