The code defines an enumeration called `NetworkType` that represents the different network types defined by the Ergo specification of `ErgoAddress`. The `ErgoAddress` class is used to represent an address on the Ergo blockchain. The `NetworkType` enumeration has two values: `MAINNET` and `TESTNET`, which represent the mainnet and testnet networks respectively.

Each value in the enumeration has two fields: `networkPrefix` and `verboseName`. The `networkPrefix` field is a byte code that is used in Ergo addresses to identify the network type. The `verboseName` field is a string that provides a human-readable name for the network type as reported by the Node API.

The `NetworkType` enumeration also has a constructor that takes two arguments: `networkPrefix` and `verboseName`. This constructor is used to initialize the fields of each value in the enumeration.

Finally, the `NetworkType` enumeration has a static method called `fromValue` that takes a string argument and returns the corresponding `NetworkType` value. This method is used to convert a string representation of a network type to the corresponding `NetworkType` value.

This code is used in the larger project to provide a way to represent the different network types supported by the Ergo blockchain. It allows developers to specify the network type when working with Ergo addresses and to convert between string representations of network types and the corresponding `NetworkType` values. For example, a developer could use the `fromValue` method to convert a string representation of a network type to the corresponding `NetworkType` value, and then use the `networkPrefix` field of the `NetworkType` value to construct an `ErgoAddress` object with the correct network prefix.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines an enumeration of network types for the Ergo blockchain and provides methods for converting between the network type's verbose name and its network prefix code used in Ergo addresses.

2. What are the possible values for the `NetworkType` enumeration?
   - The possible values are `MAINNET` and `TESTNET`, which correspond to the mainnet and testnet network types, respectively.

3. How can a developer use this code in their project?
   - A developer can use this code to interact with the Ergo blockchain by creating and manipulating Ergo addresses. They can also use the `fromValue` method to convert a verbose network name to its corresponding `NetworkType` value.
