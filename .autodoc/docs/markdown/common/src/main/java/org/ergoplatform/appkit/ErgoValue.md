The `ErgoValue` class is a representation of any valid value of the ErgoScript language. It is equipped with an `ErgoType` descriptor that describes the type of the value. This class provides methods to encode the value as a Base16 hex string, get the value and type, and create new instances of `ErgoValue` for different types of values.

The `toHex()` method transforms the value into a `Values.ConstantNode` of sigma, serializes the constant into a byte array using `sigmastate.serialization.ConstantSerializer`, and encodes the bytes using Base16 encoder into a string. This method is useful for serialization and transmission of ErgoScript values.

The `of()` methods create new instances of `ErgoValue` for different types of values. For example, `of(byte value)` creates an `ErgoValue` instance for a byte value, `of(short value)` creates an instance for a short value, and so on. There are also methods for creating instances of `ErgoValue` for `BigInt`, `GroupElement`, `SigmaProp`, `AvlTree`, `Box`, and collections of values.

The `fromHex(String hex)` method creates an `ErgoValue` instance from a hex-encoded serialized byte array of Constant values. This method is useful for deserialization of ErgoScript values.

Overall, the `ErgoValue` class is an important part of the ErgoScript language and provides a convenient way to represent and manipulate ErgoScript values in Java. It can be used in the larger project to serialize and deserialize ErgoScript values, create new instances of ErgoScript values, and manipulate ErgoScript values in various ways.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ErgoValue` class?
- The `ErgoValue` class is used to represent any valid value of ErgoScript language and comes equipped with an `ErgoType` descriptor.

2. What is the `toHex()` method used for?
- The `toHex()` method is used to encode an `ErgoValue` as a Base16 hex string. It transforms the value into a `Values.ConstantNode` of sigma, serializes the constant into a byte array using `sigmastate.serialization.ConstantSerializer`, and encodes the bytes using Base16 encoder into a string.

3. How can an `ErgoValue` be created from hex encoded serialized bytes of Constant values?
- An `ErgoValue` can be created from hex encoded serialized bytes of Constant values by using the `fromHex()` method. The method takes a string obtained as hex encoding of serialized `ConstantNode` and returns a new deserialized `ErgoValue` instance.
