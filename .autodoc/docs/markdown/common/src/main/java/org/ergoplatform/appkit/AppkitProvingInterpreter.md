The `AppkitProvingInterpreter` class in the `ergo-appkit` project is responsible for holding secrets and signing transactions (i.e., generating proofs). It takes a list of secret keys, dLogInputs, dhtInputs, and ErgoLikeParameters as input. The class extends the `ErgoLikeInterpreter` and `ProverInterpreter` classes.

The `sign` method takes an unsigned transaction, boxes to spend, data boxes, state context, base cost, and tokens to burn as input. It reduces and signs the transaction, returning a signed transaction and the cost of the transaction. The `reduceTransaction` method takes an unsigned transaction, boxes to spend, data boxes, state context, base cost, and tokens to burn as input. It reduces the inputs of the given unsigned transaction to provable sigma propositions using the given context and returns a new reduced transaction with all inputs reduced and the cost of this transaction.

The `signReduced` method takes a reduced transaction and base cost as input. It generates spending proofs for each input so that the resulting transaction can be submitted to the blockchain. The `reduce` method takes a script environment, ErgoTree, and context as input. It reduces the given ErgoTree in the given context to a sigma proposition and returns a `ReducedInputData` object containing enough data to sign a transaction without context.

The `proveReduced` method generates a proof (signature) for the given message using the secrets of the prover. It takes a reduced input, message, and hints bag as input and returns a `ProverResult`.

The `TokenBalanceException` class is thrown during transaction signing when input tokens are not balanced with output tokens. The `ReducedInputData` class represents data necessary to sign an input of an unsigned transaction. The `ReducedErgoLikeTransaction` class represents a reduced transaction, i.e., an unsigned transaction where each unsigned input is augmented with `ReducedInputData`.

The `ReducedErgoLikeTransactionSerializer` object is responsible for serializing and deserializing `ReducedErgoLikeTransaction` instances.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `AppkitProvingInterpreter` class?
   **Answer**: The `AppkitProvingInterpreter` class is responsible for holding secrets and signing transactions (i.e., generating proofs) using those secrets. It takes a list of secret keys, dLogInputs, dhtInputs, and ErgoLikeParameters as input and provides methods to reduce and sign transactions.

2. **Question**: What is the `TokenBalanceException` and when is it thrown?
   **Answer**: The `TokenBalanceException` is an exception that is thrown during transaction signing when the input tokens are not balanced with the output tokens. It contains information about the token balance difference that caused the error.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `ReducedErgoLikeTransaction` case class?
   **Answer**: The `ReducedErgoLikeTransaction` case class represents a "reduced" transaction, which is an unsigned transaction where each unsigned input is augmented with `ReducedInputData` containing a script reduction result. After an unsigned transaction is reduced, it can be signed without context, allowing it to be serialized and transferred, for example, to a Cold Wallet and signed in an environment where secrets are known.
