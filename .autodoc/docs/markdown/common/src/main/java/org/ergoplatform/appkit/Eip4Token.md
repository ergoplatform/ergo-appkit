The `Eip4Token` class represents an EIP-4 compliant token, which is a standard for tokens on the Ergo blockchain. This class extends the `ErgoToken` class and adds additional fields and methods specific to EIP-4 tokens. 

The required EIP-4 fields from R4, R5, and R6 are stored as private fields in the class: `name`, `description`, and `decimals`. The optional fields R7, R8, and R9 are stored as `ErgoValue` objects, which can hold any type of Ergo data. 

The class provides several constructors for creating an `Eip4Token` object. The first constructor takes the required fields as well as the optional fields as `ErgoValue` objects. The second constructor takes only the required fields as strings. The third constructor takes all fields as arguments. 

The class provides several methods for accessing the token's fields. `getTokenName()`, `getTokenDescription()`, and `getDecimals()` return the values of the required fields. `getAmountFormatted()` returns the token amount taking decimals into account. `getAssetType()` returns the type of asset this token represents, which is an enum value of `AssetType`. 

The class also provides several methods for working with the optional fields. `getR7ByteArrayOrNull()` returns the byte content of register R7, or `null` if not set. `isNftAssetType()` returns `true` if this is an NFT token asset type according to EIP-4. `getNftContentHash()` returns the SHA256 content hash for NFT types, or `null` for non-NFT types. `getNftContentLink()` and `getNftCoverImageLink()` return the content link and cover image link for NFT types if available, otherwise `null`. 

Finally, the class provides several methods for getting the values of the token's registers for use in creating a token minting box. `getMintingBoxR4()`, `getMintingBoxR5()`, and `getMintingBoxR6()` return the values of registers R4, R5, and R6 as `ErgoValue` objects. `getMintingBoxR7()`, `getMintingBoxR8()`, and `getMintingBoxR9()` return the values of registers R7, R8, and R9 as `ErgoValue` objects, or `null` if not needed. 

Overall, the `Eip4Token` class provides a convenient way to work with EIP-4 compliant tokens on the Ergo blockchain. It can be used in conjunction with the `Eip4TokenBuilder` class to create and manage tokens.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code represents an EIP-4 compliant token and provides methods to retrieve information about the token, such as its name, description, and decimals.

2. What is the significance of the optional fields r7, r8, and r9?
- These fields represent the contents of registers 7, 8, and 9, respectively, as specified in the EIP-4 specification. They are optional and can be null.

3. What is the purpose of the AssetType enum?
- The AssetType enum represents the different types of assets that an EIP-4 compliant token can optionally represent. It provides a method to retrieve the magic bytes associated with each asset type.
