The `Constants` class in the `ergo-appkit` project is a simple implementation of a `LinkedHashMap` that is used to store values of named constants for the ErgoScript compiler. The class extends the `LinkedHashMap` class, which means that it inherits all of the methods and properties of the `LinkedHashMap` class. 

The purpose of this class is to provide a convenient way to store and retrieve named constants that can be used in ErgoScript code. The values stored in the `Constants` object can be any object that can be converted to an ErgoScript value. This includes basic data types such as integers, strings, and booleans, as well as more complex objects such as arrays and maps.

One potential use case for the `Constants` class is in the development of smart contracts for the Ergo blockchain. Smart contracts often require the use of constants that are used throughout the contract code. By storing these constants in a `Constants` object, developers can easily access and modify these values as needed.

Here is an example of how the `Constants` class might be used in a smart contract:

```
import org.ergoplatform.appkit.Constants;

public class MySmartContract {
  private Constants constants;

  public MySmartContract() {
    constants = new Constants();
    constants.put("MY_CONSTANT", 42);
  }

  public int getMyConstant() {
    return (int) constants.get("MY_CONSTANT");
  }
}
```

In this example, a new `Constants` object is created and a constant named `MY_CONSTANT` is added with a value of `42`. The `getMyConstant` method retrieves the value of `MY_CONSTANT` from the `Constants` object and returns it as an integer.

Overall, the `Constants` class provides a simple and convenient way to store and retrieve named constants in ErgoScript code.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this class?
   
   This class is used to store values of named constants for ErgoScript compiler.

2. What type of objects can be stored as values in this class?
   
   Any objects that are convertible to ErgoScript values can be stored as values in this class.

3. Is there any specific method or class that can be used to convert objects to ErgoScript values?
   
   Yes, the `liftAny` method of `SigmaBuilder` can be used to convert any object to an ErgoScript value.
