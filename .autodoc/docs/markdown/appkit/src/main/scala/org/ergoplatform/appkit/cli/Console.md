The `Console` class is an abstract interface for console interactions, such as print and read operations. It defines methods for printing a string to the output stream, reading a line from the input stream, and reading a password. The `Console` class is implemented by two concrete classes: `MainConsole` and `TestConsole`.

The `MainConsole` class is a wrapper around the system console and is intended to be used in the `Application.main` method. It provides implementations for the methods defined in the `Console` class using the `System.console()` method to access the system console.

The `TestConsole` class is a console implementation intended to be used in tests. It takes a `BufferedReader` and a `PrintStream` as input and provides implementations for the methods defined in the `Console` class using these input and output streams.

The `Console` object provides utility methods for reading a new password from the console. The `readNewPassword` method takes a number of attempts and a `Console` instance as input, along with a code block that requests the user to enter a new password twice. It then compares the two passwords and returns the password as a `SecretString` if they match. If they do not match, it prompts the user to try again up to the specified number of attempts. If the user fails to enter a valid password within the specified number of attempts, it throws a `UsageException`.

The `Console` object also provides a convenience method `readNewPassword` that takes two prompts as input and uses the `Console` instance from the `AppContext` to read the passwords.

The `ConsoleException` class is an exception thrown by the `Console` class when incorrect usage is detected.

Overall, the `Console` class and its implementations provide a way to interact with the console in a standardized way, making it easier to write and test console-based applications. The `readNewPassword` method is a useful utility for securely reading passwords from the console.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Console` abstract class?
- The `Console` abstract class defines an interface for console interactions, including print and read operations.

2. What is the purpose of the `readNewPassword` method in the `Console` object?
- The `readNewPassword` method in the `Console` object provides a secure way to double-enter a new password, allowing the user multiple attempts before failing with an exception.

3. What is the purpose of the `TestConsole` class?
- The `TestConsole` class is a console implementation to be used in tests, providing methods for printing and reading input/output streams.
