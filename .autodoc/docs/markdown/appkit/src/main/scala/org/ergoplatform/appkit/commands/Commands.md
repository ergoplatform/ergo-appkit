This code defines classes and traits that are used to implement commands for the ErgoTool application. The `Cmd` abstract class is the base class for all commands that can be executed by ErgoTool. It defines methods that return the current tool configuration parameters, the name of the command, the URL of the Ergo blockchain node used to communicate with the network, the API key used for Ergo node API authentication, and the network type (MAINNET or TESTNET) that ErgoTool is expected to communicate with. It also defines a `run` method that executes the command using the given `AppContext`.

The `RunWithErgoClient` trait can be used to implement commands that need to communicate with the Ergo blockchain. It extends the `Cmd` abstract class and overrides the `run` method to create an `ErgoClient` instance and call the `runWithClient` method with it.

The `CmdParameter` case class represents a command parameter descriptor. It contains information such as the parameter name, type, description, default value, and whether it is entered interactively or parsed from the command line.

The `CmdDescriptor` abstract class is the base class for all command descriptors (usually companion objects). It defines the command name used in the command line, the syntax for the command parameters, and a human-readable description of the command. It also defines a `createCmd` method that creates a new command instance based on the given `AppContext`, and a `parseArgs` method that parses the command line arguments into a sequence of parameter values.

The `CmdArgParser` abstract class is a parser of the command line string. It defines a `parse` method that parses the given raw string into a value of the parameter type.

The `CmdArgInput` abstract class is an input handler of `CmdParameter`. It defines an `input` method that is called to input the given parameter.

The `UsageException` case class is an exception thrown by the ErgoTool application when incorrect usage is detected. It contains an error message and an optional descriptor of the command which was incorrectly used.

The `ErgoToolException` case class is an exception thrown by the ErgoTool application before or after command execution. It contains an error message and an optional cause.

The `CmdException` case class is an exception thrown by executing `Cmd.run`, wrapping the cause if needed. It contains an error message, the command that threw the exception, and an optional cause.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Cmd` class and its methods?
- The `Cmd` class is a base class for all commands that can be executed by ErgoTool. Its methods include returning the current tool configuration parameters, returning the name of the command, returning the URL of the Ergo blockchain node used to communicate with the network, and running the command using the given `AppContext`.

2. What is the purpose of the `RunWithErgoClient` trait?
- The `RunWithErgoClient` trait can be used to implement commands that need to communicate with the Ergo blockchain. It provides a default implementation of the `run` method and declares a new method with an additional `ErgoClient` parameter, which is called from the default implementation.

3. What is the purpose of the `CmdParameter` case class and its fields?
- The `CmdParameter` case class is a descriptor for a command parameter. Its fields include the parameter name, display name, type, description, default value, interactive input, and argument parser. It is used to specify the syntax for a command and to parse its parameters from the command line.
