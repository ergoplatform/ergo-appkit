The code defines a set of classes and objects that represent command-line interface (CLI) options for the Ergo blockchain platform. The `CmdOption` class represents a single option that can be passed to a command-line tool. Each option has a name, a type, a description, and a flag indicating whether it is a boolean option (i.e., it does not have an associated value). The `ConfigOption`, `DryRunOption`, `PrintJsonOption`, and `LimitListOption` objects are instances of `CmdOption` that represent specific options that can be passed to the Ergo CLI tool.

The `CmdOption` class has two methods: `cmdText` and `helpString`. The `cmdText` method returns the text of the command line with the name of the option, while the `helpString` method returns a string that is printed for this option in the usage help output.

The `ConfigOption` object represents an option that specifies the path to a configuration file. The file has JSON content corresponding to the `ErgoToolConfig` class. The `DryRunOption` object represents an option that forces the command to report what will be done by the operation without performing the actual operation. This is useful for commands that perform some real-world effects such as sending a transaction to the blockchain. The `PrintJsonOption` object represents an option that forces commands to print objects as formatted JSON instead of rows in a table. The `LimitListOption` object represents an option that specifies a number of items in the output list.

The `CmdOption` class and its subclasses are used in the Ergo CLI tool to provide a flexible and extensible way to specify options for commands. For example, the `SendCmd` command might use the `DryRunOption` to allow users to preview the effects of sending a transaction before actually sending it. The `CmdOption` class and its subclasses can be used in other projects that require a CLI tool with extensible options. 

Example usage:

```
$ ergo-cli --conf ergo_tool.json --dry-run
```

This command runs the Ergo CLI tool with the `ConfigOption` and `DryRunOption` options. The `--conf` option specifies the path to a configuration file, and the `--dry-run` option forces the command to report what will be done by the operation without performing the actual operation.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `CmdOption` class?
- The `CmdOption` class represents a CLI option description that can be used in command line to specify parameters to be used by the command during its operation.

2. What is the difference between a regular option and a flag option?
- A regular option is given using the syntax `--optionName optionValue`, while a flag option is given using the syntax `--optionName` without an `optionValue` part. If a `CmdOption` instance has `isFlag` set to `true`, then such option doesn't have an `optionValue` part and the option is interpreted as Boolean value (`true` if it is present, `false` otherwise).

3. What are some examples of options supported by the `ergo-appkit` application?
- Some examples of options supported by the `ergo-appkit` application are `ConfigOption` (string option to specify path to a configuration file), `DryRunOption` (flag option to prevent the command to perform actual operation and instead forces it to report planned actions), `PrintJsonOption` (flag option to force commands to print objects as formatted json instead of rows in table), and `LimitListOption` (specifies a number of items in the output list).
