The `ToolParameters` class is a subclass of the `HashMap` class and is used to store key-value pairs of tool parameters. This class overrides the `equals`, `hashCode`, and `toString` methods of the `HashMap` class to provide custom implementations.

The `equals` method checks if the given object is equal to the current object by comparing their classes and calling the `equals` method of the superclass.

The `hashCode` method returns the hash code of the superclass.

The `toString` method returns a string representation of the object by calling the `toIndentedString` method and appending it to a string builder.

The `toIndentedString` method is a private helper method that converts the given object to a string with each line indented by 4 spaces (except the first line).

This class can be used to store tool parameters in a key-value format and to compare them with other instances of the `ToolParameters` class. For example, if we have two instances of `ToolParameters` called `params1` and `params2`, we can compare them using the `equals` method like this:

```
if (params1.equals(params2)) {
    // do something
}
```

We can also print the contents of a `ToolParameters` object using the `toString` method like this:

```
ToolParameters params = new ToolParameters();
params.put("param1", "value1");
params.put("param2", "value2");
System.out.println(params.toString());
```

This will output:

```
class Parameters {
    {param1=value1, param2=value2}
}
```

Overall, the `ToolParameters` class provides a convenient way to store and compare tool parameters in a key-value format.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ToolParameters` class?
    
    The `ToolParameters` class extends `HashMap<String, String>` and provides methods for overriding `equals`, `hashCode`, and `toString` methods.

2. Why does the `equals` method check if the object is of the same class?
    
    The `equals` method checks if the object is of the same class to ensure that the comparison is only done between objects of the same type.

3. What is the purpose of the `toIndentedString` method?
    
    The `toIndentedString` method is a private helper method that converts an object to a string with each line indented by 4 spaces, except the first line. It is used by the `toString` method to format the output.
