The `ErgoNodeConfig` class is a part of the `ergo-appkit` project and is used to define the parameters of an Ergo node that will be used by the `ErgoClient`. The `ErgoClient` is a Java library that provides a high-level API for interacting with the Ergo blockchain. 

The `ErgoNodeConfig` class has three private fields: `nodeApi`, `wallet`, and `networkType`. The `nodeApi` field is an instance of the `ApiConfig` class, which defines the connection parameters for the Ergo node's API. The `wallet` field is an instance of the `WalletConfig` class, which defines the parameters for working with the wallet. The `networkType` field is an instance of the `NetworkType` enum, which specifies the expected network type (Mainnet or Testnet).

The class has three public methods: `getNodeApi()`, `getWallet()`, and `getNetworkType()`. These methods return the values of the corresponding private fields. 

This class can be used to configure an instance of the `ErgoClient` class. For example, to create an instance of the `ErgoClient` that connects to the Testnet Ergo node with the specified API and wallet configurations, the following code can be used:

```
ApiConfig apiConfig = new ApiConfig("http://localhost:9053");
WalletConfig walletConfig = new WalletConfig("testnet", "password");
ErgoNodeConfig nodeConfig = new ErgoNodeConfig(apiConfig, walletConfig, NetworkType.TESTNET);
ErgoClient client = ErgoClient.create(nodeConfig);
```

In this example, the `ApiConfig` and `WalletConfig` instances are created with the necessary parameters, and then an instance of the `ErgoNodeConfig` class is created with these instances and the `NetworkType.TESTNET` enum value. Finally, an instance of the `ErgoClient` class is created with the `ErgoNodeConfig` instance. 

Overall, the `ErgoNodeConfig` class is an important part of the `ergo-appkit` project that allows developers to configure an instance of the `ErgoClient` class with the necessary parameters to interact with the Ergo blockchain.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a class called `ErgoNodeConfig` that contains parameters for connecting to an Ergo node and working with its wallet.

2. What other classes or files does this code interact with?
- This code imports the `org.ergoplatform.appkit.NetworkType` class and uses it as a parameter type for the `networkType` field.

3. How can this code be used in a larger project?
- This code can be used to configure and connect to an Ergo node in a Java-based project that interacts with the Ergo blockchain. Other classes in the `org.ergoplatform.appkit` package may also be used in conjunction with this class.
