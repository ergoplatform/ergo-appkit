The `ScalaBridge` object in the `ergo-appkit` project provides a set of implicit conversions between Java and Scala data structures used in the Ergo platform. These conversions are essential for seamless interoperability between the Java-based Ergo AppKit and the Scala-based Ergo platform.

The conversions are implemented using `Iso` instances, which define a bidirectional mapping between two types. For example, the `isoSpendingProof` instance converts between `SpendingProof` (Java) and `ProverResult` (Scala) types. This allows developers to work with Ergo platform data structures in a more familiar Java environment while still leveraging the power of the Scala-based Ergo platform.

Some of the key conversions provided by `ScalaBridge` include:

- `isoSpendingProof`: Converts between `SpendingProof` and `ProverResult`.
- `isoErgoTransactionDataInput`: Converts between `ErgoTransactionDataInput` and `DataInput`.
- `isoErgoTransactionInput`: Converts between `ErgoTransactionInput` and `Input`.
- `isoErgoTransactionUnsignedInput`: Converts between `ErgoTransactionUnsignedInput` and `UnsignedInput`.
- `isoAssetToErgoToken`: Converts between `Asset` and `ErgoToken`.
- `isoStringToErgoTree`: Converts between `String` and `ErgoTree`.
- `isoRegistersToMap`: Converts between `Registers` and `AdditionalRegisters`.
- `isoErgoTransactionOutput`: Converts between `ErgoTransactionOutput` and `ErgoBox`.
- `isoBlockHeader`: Converts between `BlockHeader` and `Header`.
- `isoErgoTransaction`: Converts between `ErgoTransaction` and `ErgoLikeTransaction`.
- `isoUnsignedErgoTransaction`: Converts between `UnsignedErgoTransaction` and `UnsignedErgoLikeTransaction`.

These conversions are used throughout the Ergo AppKit to enable seamless interaction between Java and Scala components. For example, when creating a new Ergo transaction, a developer can use the Java-based `ErgoTransaction` class, which is then converted to the Scala-based `ErgoLikeTransaction` using the `isoErgoTransaction` conversion before being processed by the Ergo platform.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `ScalaBridge` object?**

   The `ScalaBridge` object is used to provide implicit conversions (isomorphisms) between different types used in the ergo-appkit project. It helps to convert between Java and Scala types, as well as between different representations of the same data structures.

2. **What are the main types being converted in this code?**

   The main types being converted in this code are related to Ergo transactions, inputs, outputs, and additional data structures like ErgoToken, ErgoTree, and AdditionalRegisters. The conversions are provided as implicit values of type `Iso[A, B]`, which define a bidirectional conversion between types A and B.

3. **How are the conversions between types implemented?**

   The conversions between types are implemented using the `Iso[A, B]` trait, which defines two methods: `to(a: A): B` and `from(b: B): A`. Each implicit value of type `Iso[A, B]` provides a specific implementation of these methods to convert between the corresponding types A and B. The conversions are then used implicitly when needed, thanks to the `convertTo` and `convertFrom` extension methods provided by the `org.ergoplatform.appkit.JavaHelpers` object.
