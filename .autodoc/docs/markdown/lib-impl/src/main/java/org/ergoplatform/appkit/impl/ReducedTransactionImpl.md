The `ReducedTransactionImpl` class is a part of the `ergo-appkit` project and provides an implementation of the `ReducedTransaction` interface. The purpose of this class is to provide a simplified view of an Ergo transaction that can be used by developers to interact with the Ergo blockchain.

The `ReducedTransactionImpl` constructor takes two parameters: a `BlockchainContextBase` object and a `ReducedErgoLikeTransaction` object. The `BlockchainContextBase` object provides context for the transaction, while the `ReducedErgoLikeTransaction` object represents the transaction itself. The `ReducedTransactionImpl` class provides several methods that allow developers to interact with the transaction.

The `getId()` method returns the ID of the transaction. The ID is a unique identifier for the transaction that can be used to retrieve it from the blockchain.

The `getInputBoxesIds()` method returns a list of IDs for the input boxes of the transaction. An input box is a box that is being spent by the transaction. The IDs can be used to retrieve the input boxes from the blockchain.

The `getOutputs()` method returns a list of `OutBox` objects that represent the output boxes of the transaction. An output box is a box that is being created by the transaction. The `OutBox` interface provides methods for interacting with the output box.

The `getTx()` method returns the underlying `ReducedErgoLikeTransaction` object.

The `getCost()` method returns the cost of the transaction. The cost is a measure of the computational resources required to execute the transaction.

The `toBytes()` method serializes the transaction to a byte array.

The `hashCode()` and `equals()` methods are used for comparing transactions.

The `toString()` method returns a string representation of the transaction.

Overall, the `ReducedTransactionImpl` class provides a simplified view of an Ergo transaction that can be used by developers to interact with the Ergo blockchain. Developers can use the methods provided by this class to retrieve information about a transaction, such as its ID, input boxes, output boxes, and cost. They can also serialize the transaction to a byte array and compare transactions using the `hashCode()` and `equals()` methods.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ReducedTransactionImpl` class?
- The `ReducedTransactionImpl` class is an implementation of the `ReducedTransaction` interface, which provides methods for retrieving information about a reduced version of an Ergo transaction.

2. What is the significance of the `getOutputs` method?
- The `getOutputs` method returns a list of `OutBox` objects, which represent the output boxes of the transaction.

3. What is the purpose of the `toBytes` method?
- The `toBytes` method serializes the `ReducedErgoLikeTransaction` object to a byte array using the Sigma serialization format.
