The `NodeInfoParameters` class is a part of the `ergo-appkit` project and implements the `BlockchainParameters` interface. It takes in a `NodeInfo` object as a parameter in its constructor and provides methods to retrieve various blockchain parameters from it. 

The `NodeInfo` object contains information about the node, such as the network type, block size, and various costs associated with transactions. The `NodeInfoParameters` class extracts this information and provides it in a format that can be used by other parts of the `ergo-appkit` project.

For example, the `getNetworkType()` method returns the network type of the node, which can be used to determine whether the node is running on the mainnet or testnet. The `getMaxBlockSize()` method returns the maximum block size allowed by the node, which can be used to ensure that blocks created by the project do not exceed this limit.

Overall, the `NodeInfoParameters` class provides a convenient way to access blockchain parameters from a `NodeInfo` object and use them in other parts of the `ergo-appkit` project. 

Example usage:

```
NodeInfo nodeInfo = getNodeInfo(); // get NodeInfo object from somewhere
BlockchainParameters params = new NodeInfoParameters(nodeInfo);
int maxBlockSize = params.getMaxBlockSize(); // get the maximum block size allowed by the node
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code defines a class called `NodeInfoParameters` that implements the `BlockchainParameters` interface and retrieves various blockchain parameters from a `NodeInfo` object.

2. What is the `BlockchainParameters` interface and what methods does it define?
    
    The `BlockchainParameters` interface is implemented by the `NodeInfoParameters` class and defines methods for retrieving various blockchain parameters such as network type, storage fee factor, minimum value per byte, etc.

3. What is the `NodeInfo` class and where does it come from?
    
    The `NodeInfo` class is used to retrieve information about a node on the Ergo blockchain network and is likely part of the Ergo REST API client library. It is used in this code to retrieve various blockchain parameters.
