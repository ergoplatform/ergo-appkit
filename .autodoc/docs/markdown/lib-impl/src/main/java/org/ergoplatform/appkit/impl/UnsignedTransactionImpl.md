The `UnsignedTransactionImpl` class is a part of the `ergo-appkit` project and provides an implementation of the `UnsignedTransaction` interface. It represents an unsigned transaction that can be used to spend unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) on the Ergo blockchain. 

The class has several fields that store information about the transaction, including the unsigned transaction itself (`_tx`), the list of input boxes to spend (`_boxesToSpend`), the list of data boxes (`_dataBoxes`), the list of tokens to burn (`_tokensToBurn`), the list of outputs (`_outputs`), the change address (`_changeAddress`), the state context (`_stateContext`), and the blockchain context (`_ctx`).

The class provides several methods to access and manipulate the transaction data. The `getId()` method returns the ID of the transaction. The `getInputs()` method returns a list of input boxes as `InputBox` objects. The `getInputBoxesIds()` method returns a list of input box IDs as strings. The `getOutputs()` method returns a list of output boxes as `OutBox` objects. The `getDataInputs()` method returns a list of data boxes as `InputBox` objects. The `getChangeAddress()` method returns the change address for the transaction. The `getTokensToBurn()` method returns a list of tokens to burn.

The `toJson()` method returns a JSON representation of the transaction. It takes two boolean parameters: `prettyPrint` and `formatJson`. If `prettyPrint` is true, the JSON output is formatted with indentation and line breaks. If `formatJson` is true, the JSON output is formatted with additional whitespace.

Overall, the `UnsignedTransactionImpl` class provides a convenient way to create and manipulate unsigned transactions on the Ergo blockchain. It can be used in conjunction with other classes in the `ergo-appkit` project to build more complex applications that interact with the blockchain. 

Example usage:

```
// create an unsigned transaction
UnsignedErgoLikeTransaction tx = ...;
List<ExtendedInputBox> boxesToSpend = ...;
List<ErgoBox> dataBoxes = ...;
ErgoAddress changeAddress = ...;
ErgoLikeStateContext stateContext = ...;
BlockchainContextImpl ctx = ...;
List<ErgoToken> tokensToBurn = ...;
UnsignedTransactionImpl unsignedTx = new UnsignedTransactionImpl(tx, boxesToSpend, dataBoxes, changeAddress, stateContext, ctx, tokensToBurn);

// get the ID of the transaction
String txId = unsignedTx.getId();

// get the list of input boxes
List<InputBox> inputBoxes = unsignedTx.getInputs();

// get the list of output boxes
List<OutBox> outputBoxes = unsignedTx.getOutputs();

// get the change address
ErgoAddress changeAddr = unsignedTx.getChangeAddress();

// convert the transaction to JSON
String json = unsignedTx.toJson(true, true);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `UnsignedTransactionImpl` class?
- The `UnsignedTransactionImpl` class is an implementation of the `UnsignedTransaction` interface and provides methods for constructing and manipulating unsigned Ergo transactions.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of an unsigned transaction represented by this code?
- The inputs of an unsigned transaction are represented by a list of `ExtendedInputBox` objects, while the outputs are represented by a list of `ErgoBoxCandidate` objects.
- Additionally, there is a list of `ErgoBox` objects representing data inputs, and a single `ErgoAddress` object representing the change address.

3. What is the purpose of the `toJson` method in this class?
- The `toJson` method is used to serialize an unsigned transaction object to JSON format, with the option to pretty-print the output and format the resulting JSON string.
