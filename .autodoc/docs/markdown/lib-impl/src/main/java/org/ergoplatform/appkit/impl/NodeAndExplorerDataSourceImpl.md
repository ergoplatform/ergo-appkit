The `NodeAndExplorerDataSourceImpl` class is an implementation of the `BlockchainDataSource` interface that provides access to blockchain data through both the Node API and the Explorer API. The Node API is preferred, but the Explorer API is optional and can be used as a fallback. 

The class provides methods for retrieving blockchain parameters, block headers, input boxes, and unspent boxes for a given address. It also provides methods for sending transactions and retrieving unconfirmed transactions. 

The `getNodeInfo` method retrieves information about the node, including the blockchain parameters, which are cached to avoid multiple fetches. The `getLastBlockHeaders` method retrieves the last `count` block headers, optionally including only full headers. The `getBoxById` method retrieves an input box by its ID, optionally searching for it in the pool or spent boxes. The `sendTransaction` method sends a signed transaction to the node, optionally checking it with the `checkTransaction` endpoint before sending. The `getUnspentBoxesFor` method retrieves unspent boxes for a given address, using the Explorer API. The `getUnconfirmedUnspentBoxesFor` method retrieves unconfirmed unspent boxes for a given address, using both the Node API and the Explorer API. The `getUnconfirmedTransactions` method retrieves unconfirmed transactions from the node. 

The class also provides getters for the API clients, which can be used for making custom API calls. 

Example usage:

```java
ErgoClient client = ...;
BlockchainDataSource dataSource = client.getBlockchainContext().getDataSource();
BlockchainParameters params = dataSource.getParameters();
List<BlockHeader> headers = dataSource.getLastBlockHeaders(10, true);
Address address = Address.create("9f9e9d8d9c9b9a999897969594939291908f8e");
List<InputBox> unspentBoxes = dataSource.getUnspentBoxesFor(address, 0, 10);
List<Transaction> unconfirmedTxs = dataSource.getUnconfirmedTransactions(0, 10);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this class?
    
    This class is a BlockchainDataSource implementation that uses both Node API and Explorer API to interact with the Ergo blockchain. It provides methods to retrieve blockchain parameters, block headers, input boxes, and transactions, as well as to send signed transactions.

2. What is the significance of the performCheckBeforeSend boolean variable?
    
    The performCheckBeforeSend boolean variable, when set to true, makes the sendTransaction method call the node's checkTransaction endpoint before actually sending the transaction. This is useful for verifying that the transaction is valid and will be accepted by the node before committing it to the blockchain.

3. What is the purpose of the executeCall method?
    
    The executeCall method is a helper method that executes an API call and handles any exceptions that may occur. It is used throughout the class to execute API calls to both the Node API and Explorer API.
