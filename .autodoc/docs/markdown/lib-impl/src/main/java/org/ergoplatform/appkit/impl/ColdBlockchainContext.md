The `ColdBlockchainContext` class is a part of the `ergo-appkit` project and is used to create a context for interacting with the Ergo blockchain. This class extends the `BlockchainContextBase` class and provides an implementation for several of its abstract methods. 

The purpose of this class is to provide a context for interacting with the Ergo blockchain in a cold environment, meaning that it does not have access to a data source or pre header builder. This is useful for scenarios where the user wants to create and sign transactions offline, without the need for a network connection. 

The `ColdBlockchainContext` class takes two parameters: `networkType` and `params`. `networkType` is an enum that specifies the network type (Mainnet or Testnet) and `params` is an instance of the `BlockchainParameters` class that contains various parameters related to the blockchain. 

The class provides implementations for several methods, including `getParameters`, which returns the `BlockchainParameters` instance passed to the constructor, and `newProverBuilder`, which returns a new instance of `ErgoProverBuilderImpl` that can be used to create a new `ErgoProver` instance for signing transactions. 

Other methods such as `getHeight`, `sendTransaction`, `getUnspentBoxesFor`, and `getCoveringBoxesFor` are not implemented and will throw an exception if called. These methods are typically used for interacting with the blockchain data source and are not available in a cold environment. 

Here is an example of how the `ColdBlockchainContext` class can be used to create a new `ErgoProver` instance:

```
val networkType = NetworkType.TESTNET
val params = new BlockchainParameters()
val context = new ColdBlockchainContext(networkType, params)
val prover = context.newProverBuilder().build()
```

In this example, a new `ColdBlockchainContext` instance is created with the `TESTNET` network type and default blockchain parameters. A new `ErgoProver` instance is then created using the `newProverBuilder` method of the context. This `ErgoProver` instance can be used to sign transactions offline.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ColdBlockchainContext` class?
- The `ColdBlockchainContext` class is a subclass of `BlockchainContextBase` that provides methods for interacting with the Ergo blockchain in a cold (offline) environment.

2. What is the difference between `getUnspentBoxesFor` and `getCoveringBoxesFor` methods?
- The `getUnspentBoxesFor` method returns a list of unspent input boxes for a given address, while the `getCoveringBoxesFor` method returns a `CoveringBoxes` object that contains a list of input boxes that cover a specified amount of Ergs and tokens for a given address.

3. What does the `signedTxFromJson` method do?
- The `signedTxFromJson` method is not implemented and throws a `NotImplementedError` when called. It is likely intended to parse a JSON string representation of a signed transaction and return a `SignedTransaction` object.
