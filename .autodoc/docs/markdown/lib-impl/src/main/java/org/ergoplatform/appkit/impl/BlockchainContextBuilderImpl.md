The `BlockchainContextBuilderImpl` class is a part of the `ergo-appkit` project and is responsible for building a `BlockchainContext` object. The `BlockchainContext` object is used to interact with the Ergo blockchain and provides access to various blockchain-related functionalities.

The `BlockchainContextBuilderImpl` class implements the `BlockchainContextBuilder` interface, which defines a method `build()` that returns a `BlockchainContext` object. The `build()` method takes no arguments and throws an `ErgoClientException` if there is an error while building the `BlockchainContext` object.

The `BlockchainContextBuilderImpl` constructor takes two arguments: a `BlockchainDataSource` object and a `NetworkType` object. The `BlockchainDataSource` object represents the data source used to connect to the Ergo blockchain, while the `NetworkType` object represents the type of network (mainnet, testnet, etc.) that the `BlockchainContext` object will be used for.

The `build()` method creates a new `BlockchainContextImpl` object by passing the `BlockchainDataSource` and `NetworkType` objects to its constructor. The `BlockchainContextImpl` class is another implementation of the `BlockchainContext` interface and provides the actual implementation of the various blockchain-related functionalities.

Here is an example of how the `BlockchainContextBuilderImpl` class can be used to build a `BlockchainContext` object:

```
BlockchainDataSource dataSource = new MyBlockchainDataSource();
NetworkType networkType = NetworkType.TESTNET;
BlockchainContextBuilder builder = new BlockchainContextBuilderImpl(dataSource, networkType);
BlockchainContext context = builder.build();
```

In this example, a custom `BlockchainDataSource` object is created and the `NetworkType` is set to `TESTNET`. Then, a new `BlockchainContextBuilderImpl` object is created by passing the `BlockchainDataSource` and `NetworkType` objects to its constructor. Finally, the `build()` method is called on the `BlockchainContextBuilderImpl` object to create a new `BlockchainContext` object. The `BlockchainContext` object can then be used to interact with the Ergo blockchain.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a class implementation of the `BlockchainContextBuilder` interface for building a `BlockchainContext` object.

2. What are the parameters of the `BlockchainContextBuilderImpl` constructor?
- The constructor takes in a `BlockchainDataSource` object and a `NetworkType` object as parameters.

3. What does the `build()` method do?
- The `build()` method creates and returns a new `BlockchainContextImpl` object using the `_dataSource` and `_networkType` parameters passed in the constructor.
