The `InputBoxImpl` class is part of the `ergo-appkit` project and provides an implementation of the `InputBox` interface. The purpose of this class is to represent an input box in an Ergo transaction. An input box is an ErgoBox that is being spent in a transaction. The class provides methods to access the properties of an input box such as its ID, value, creation height, tokens, registers, and ergo tree. It also provides methods to convert an input box to JSON format and to get the bytes of the input box.

The class has three constructors that take different types of input data. The first constructor takes an `ErgoTransactionOutput` object, which is the output of a previous transaction that is being spent. The second constructor takes an `OutputInfo` object, which is a summary of an output on the blockchain. The third constructor takes an `ErgoBox` object, which is an input box being spent in a transaction.

The `withContextVars` method allows the user to add context variables to the input box. Context variables are used to provide additional information to the script that is being executed in the input box. The `toErgoValue` method returns an `ErgoValue` object that represents the input box as a Sigma value.

Overall, the `InputBoxImpl` class provides a convenient way to access the properties of an input box in an Ergo transaction. It can be used in the larger `ergo-appkit` project to build and sign Ergo transactions. Below is an example of how to use the `InputBoxImpl` class to get the value of an input box:

```
InputBox inputBox = new InputBoxImpl(ergoBox);
long value = inputBox.getValue();
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `InputBoxImpl` class?
    
    `InputBoxImpl` is a class that implements the `InputBox` interface and provides methods to access and manipulate data related to an input box in the Ergo blockchain.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
    
    This code uses several external libraries, including `com.google.gson`, `org.ergoplatform`, `org.ergoplatform.appkit`, `org.ergoplatform.explorer.client.model`, `org.ergoplatform.restapi.client`, `sigmastate`, and `special.sigma`.

3. What methods are available to access data related to an input box?
    
    The `InputBoxImpl` class provides several methods to access data related to an input box, including `getId()`, `getValue()`, `getCreationHeight()`, `getTokens()`, `getRegisters()`, `getErgoTree()`, `getAttachment()`, `withContextVars()`, `toJson()`, `getBytes()`, `getTransactionId()`, `getTransactionIndex()`, `getErgoBox()`, `getExtension()`, `toString()`, and `toErgoValue()`.
