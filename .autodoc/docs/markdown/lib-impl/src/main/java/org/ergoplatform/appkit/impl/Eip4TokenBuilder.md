The `Eip4TokenBuilder` class provides convenience methods for building an `Eip4Token`, which is a type of token used in the Ergo blockchain. The class contains several static methods that can be used to build an `Eip4Token` from different sources, such as hex-encoded registers, additional registers returned by the Ergo Explorer API, or an `ErgoBox` object.

The `buildFromHexEncodedRegisters` method takes a token ID, token amount, and a list of hex-encoded register values for registers R4-R9. It decodes the register values and creates an `Eip4Token` object with the given parameters.

The `buildFromAdditionalRegisters` method takes a token ID, token amount, and an `AdditionalRegisters` object returned by the Ergo Explorer API. It extracts the register values for registers R4-R9 from the `AdditionalRegisters` object and creates an `Eip4Token` object using the `buildFromHexEncodedRegisters` method.

The `buildFromExplorerByTokenId` and `buildFromExplorerByIssuingBox` methods use the Ergo Explorer API to retrieve information about a token or an issuing box and create an `Eip4Token` object from the returned data.

The `buildFromErgoBox` method takes a token ID and an `ErgoBox` object and creates an `Eip4Token` object from the token information stored in the `ErgoBox`.

The class also provides several methods for building specific types of `Eip4Token` objects, such as NFT picture, video, and audio tokens, as well as an NFT artwork collection token.

Overall, the `Eip4TokenBuilder` class provides a convenient way to create `Eip4Token` objects from various sources, making it easier to work with tokens in the Ergo blockchain.
